advanceddisease often requires radiation or chemotherapy alone surgery is the only treatment option for patients with gacadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are also oftenused targeted therapy isin the exploration stage however there are currently no speciï¬c national comprehensivecancer network guidelines for the treatment of only gscbecause the tumor is relatively rare although complete surgicalresection is the most important treatment method for examplewhile chemotherapy is considered in clinical practice whetherchemotherapy can be applied for gsc and the eï¬cacy ofchemotherapy remain controversial  domblides   ï¬rstevaluated the eï¬cacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors icis forsc and found that lung sc patients exhibited high response ratesand prolonged overall survival os with icis  this studyprovides a new idea for the treatment of gscbecause gl tends to be conï¬ned to the gastric wall forprolonged periods before tumor spread its prognosis is betterthan that of gac  previous literature has found that scin the parotid gland lung hypopharynx liver and pancreashave poor prognoses due to metastasis or recurrence with asurvival period of a few months   similarly gscpatients also died or developed metastasis or recurrence withina few months or it was already in the advanced stage at theï¬rst diagnosis all these clinical manifestations suggest that gschas a poorer prognosis than gac and gl  in additiongsc can metastasize through the blood and lymph nodesand the most common sites of metastasis are the local lymphnodes and liver  this conclusion is consistent with ourresearch resultsconclusionthe incidence rate of gsc is extremely low so clinicians andradiologists are not familiar with the features of this tumorbased on systematic research of this rare tumor and comparisonswith common gastric cancers we found that gsc is morecommon in men who are approximately  years old and isoften accompanied by ulcers the disease is mostly located in theproximal part of the stomach and can also occur in the remnantstomach with delayed enhancement on contrastenhanced ctimages these characteristics can provide a reference for furtherresearch on gscs

fifth leading cause of cancerrelated death forboth sexes in china   in a multidisciplinary approach thatcombines chemotherapy with radiotherapy for the treatmentof colorectal cancer surgery remains the major approach thefirst successful use of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery waspublished in  by jacobs     laparoscopic surgery hasbeen performed widely in colon cancer all over the world andseveral randomizedcontrolled trials have demonstrated thatlaparoscopic surgery for colon cancer is safe and feasible withbetter shortterm outcomes including a decrease in postoperative pain a shorter hospital stay and earlier recoveryand equivalent longterm results compared to open surgery[] however laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer is morearduous than that for colon cancer so the early clinical trialsexcluded rectal cancer [] although a few clinical trialshave shown the advantages of laparoscopic rectalcancer resection compared with open surgery [] both the acosogz6051 and alacart trials did not support the use of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer [ ] it is still controversialwhether laparoscopic surgery is suitable for rectal cancer especially for low rectal cancer therefore we conducted thisretrospective cohort study to compare longterm survival outcomes and shortterm surgical safety between laparoscopicand open surgery for nonmetastatic rectal cancer in

factors of age gender bmi preoperative cea level tumor location and tumor stage were used as described in the protocolthe baseline characteristics were ideally balanced between thelaparoscopic and open groupssome studies have reported similar postoperative complications and mortality between laparoscopic surgery and opensurgery for rectal cancer [ ] and other studies have reportedfewer postoperative complications after laparoscopic surgerythan after open surgery [ ] in our study there were no significant differences in postoperative complications includingwound infectionileus urinarytract infection anastomosisleakageintraabdominal bleeding pneumonia and cardiacevent between the two groups the longer operative time is often considered a disadvantage of laparoscopic surgery according to some previous reports [ ] in contrast our studyshowed that the operative time of laparoscopic surgery wasshorter than that of open surgery the clasicc trial and colorii trial both showed that hospital stay was significantly shorterin the laparoscopic group [ ] similarly our study alsoshowed that the hospital stay for laparoscopic surgery wasshorter than for open surgerywith regard to longterm survival no largescale clinical trials have demonstrated a statistically significant difference between laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer thecolor ii trial indicated no statistically significant differences indfs and os between laparoscopic and open surgeries   inthe corean study dfs in laparoscopic surgery is noninferiorcompared to that in open surgery for mid or low rectal cancer  consistently with previous studies os rfs and css didnot differ in both groups in our study interestingly subgroupanalyses for os showed that male and intermediate bmi  to kgm2

thebmi subgroup unfavorable for laparoscopic surgery that weidentified was intermediate bmi not high bmi it might be dueto lower bmi in the chinese population compared to that in thewestern population and the small proportion  of patientswith high bmi in our cohort further evaluation will be neededto determine which subgroups of patients require additional attention when undergoing laparoscopic surgerylymphovascularwe evaluated several possible prognostic factors that mayinfluence survival in patients with rectal cancer including tumor location tumor stage tumor grade surgical approach preoperative cea levelinvasion perineuralinvasion and tumor deposits [] as expected our studyshowed that perineural invasion was the significant prognosticfactor affecting os and rfs perineural invasion refers to the invasion of cancer cells into any of the layers of the nerve sheatha higher grade of perineural invasion was related to local recurrence and metastasis in distant ans such as the liver lungand peritoneum   all patients in this study underwent radical surgery with lymphnode dissection a minimum of  harvested lymph nodes is recommended to ensure adequatestaging and oncologic resection for colorectal cancer   themore lymph nodes harvested the better the prognosis [ ]in this study the average number of harvested lymph nodeswas    we found that patients with  15 harvested lymphnodes had better os and rfs than those with  harvestedlymph nodes several studies have shown that elevated preoperative cea was a poor prognostic factor in colorectal cancer[] in our study we also found that patients with an elevated preoperative cea had poorer os and rfsour study has several limitations first a selection biasexisted due to its retrospective design to reduce this the twogroups were matched carefully using psm second the statistical power is insufficient because the number of patients enrolled may not be sufficient after matching third data aboutadjuvant therapy after surgery were not collected which mightbe different between both groups and thus have influenced survival outcomes fourth the exclusion of converted cases mayintroduce a bias in favor of laparoscopic surgery finally thebowelrecovery data could not be exactly assessed due to thelack of records in this retrospective study therefore further research with a large population is still awaitedanydifferencesinin  our study revealed the benefit of laparoscopicsurgery on shortterm outcomes including less blood lossshorter operative time and shorter hospital stay we did

therewas no severe anemia in any patients in this study furthermore compared with warfarin the incidence of gi bleedingis higher in association with doacs the causes of gi bleeding in association with doacs are bleeding from colon astric cancers and diverticular hemorrhages however noneof these lesions detected by egd and colonoscopy had activebleeding doacs did not aï¬ect bleeding from the upper gitract and the colon in this studyno significant diï¬erences were observed among thedoacs in relation to smallbowel lesions the ï¬ndings fromthe randomized evaluation of longterm anticoagulationtherapy trial of dabigatran showed that in the warfaringroup  patients with gi tract bleeding had gastric canceror colonic cancer and that in the dabigatran group patients with gi tract bleeding had colonic cancer and patient had gastric cancer   hence dabigatran mightinduce gi tract bleeding from colon cancer   rivaroxaban apixaban and edoxaban compete directly with the s1pocket of factor xa and inhibit factor xa activity whereasdabigatran is a prodrug that is activated in the presence ofesterase in the gi tract plasma and liver the causes of themucosal damage by dabigatran were thought to be due todirect acting at the local area where it is absorbed in addition tartaric acid coats dabigatran tablets and the tabletscan cause mucosal damage if they are retained within theesophagus while we expected an increase in the frequencyof intestinal mucosal injury among the patients who tookdabigatran as a consequence of the tartaric acid coating this 0cgastroenterology

evaluated the relative expression levels of vg and vgr in different treatments significant upregulation and downregulation in expression level of two genes in response to diapause termination and diapause fat body tissue was respectively observed when using arp3 as the reference gene but not when using an unstable reference gene the reference genes identified in this work provided not only the

regulatory mechanisms of mirnas in cc remain to be fully elucidated the aim of the present study was to examine the functions of mirnas in cc and the possible mechanisms using a microarray it was identified that mirna15a5p mir15a5p was one of the most downregulated mirnas in cc tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues the low expression of mir15a5p was observed in cc tumor tissues with distant metastasis and in cc cell lines in addition the effects of mir15a5p upregulation on cell viability apoptosis invasion and migration of cc cells were investigated using cck flow cytometry transwell and wound healing assays respectively it was demonstrated that upregulation of mir15a5p significantly suppressed the viability migration and invasion and promoted the apoptosis of siha and c33a cells furthermore yesassociated protein  yap1 a wellknown oncogene was confirmed to be directly targeted by mir15a5p and was found to be negatively regulated by mir15a5p further correlation analysis indicated that mir15a5p expression was negatively correlated with yap1 expression in cc tissues notably overexpression of yap1 abrogated the tumor suppressive effects of mir15a5p in cc cells

the abnormal growth of epithelial cells  thus it is imperative to clarify the molecular interactions occurring during the initiation and progression of ccmicrornas mirnas are a family of short noncoding rnas with an average length of  nucleotides which negatively regulate target gene expression through either translation repression or rna degradation  accumulating evidence has indicated that mirnas may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on their target mrna in various types of cancer including cc  for example yang    reported that mir214 inhibits the growth of cc

reported that mir499a promotes the proliferation cell cycle progression colony formation migration and invasion of cc cells by targeting srybox transcription factor  in addition several mirnas serve as diagnostic biomarkers in patients with cc such as mir152 and mir365  despite the aforementioned findings the roles of mirnas in the development of cc require further investigationin the present study a mirna microarray was performed to investigate the expression profiles of mirnas in cc tissues and the most downregulated mirna identified mir15a5p was selected for further analysis the

demonstrated increased expression compared with that in adjacent noncancerous tissues fig 1a among the aberrant mirnas the present study focused on mir15a5p for subsequent experiments due to its suppressive role in a variety of other cancer types such as endometrial cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia  subsequently rtqpcr was performed to detect the expression of mir15a5p in  pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues the results revealed that the level of mir15a5p was significantly lower in tumor tissues compared with that in adjacent noncancerous tissues fig 1b it was also observed that mir15a5p was expressed at a significantly lower level in tumor tissues with distant metastasis compared with in tumors tissues without distant metastasis fig 1c indicating that

it was identified that the invasive capacities of siha and c33a cells were significantly inhibited by mir15a5p mimic whereas they were increased by mir15a5p inhibitor compared with the nc groups furthermore the wound healing assay results also demonstrated a significant reduction of cell migration in siha and c33a cells following mir15a5p overexpression however the migration of siha and c33a

mir15a5p the expression of yap1 protein was measured in cc cells by western blotting as presented in fig 4c the expression of yap1 was significantly decreased upon ectopic expression of mir15a5p suggesting that high expression of yap1 was partly due to the downregulation of mir15a5p in cc cells in addition it was identified that the mrna level of yap1 was significantly increased in cervical cancer compared with the control and inversely correlated with mir15a5p expression levels in cancer tissues fig 4d and e these results indicated that yap1 is a downstream gene of mir15a5p in cc 0cchen

that yap1 is upregulated in cc it was hypothesized that yap1 may act as an oncogenic gene in cc to confirm this hypothesis siha and c33a cells were transfected with siyap1 or siscramble western blot assay revealed that yap1 was notably downregulated following transfection with siyap1 fig 5a functionally yap1knockdown significantly suppressed the cell viability and induced cell apoptosis compared with the siscramble group fig 5b and c furthermore knockdown of yap1 significantly suppressed the invasive and migratory abilities of siha and c33a cells fig 5d and e suggesting that yap1 may play an oncogene role in the development of ccoverexpression of yap1 moderates the negative functions of mir15a5p on cell viability migration and invasion to ascertain whether yap1 is involved in the inhibitory effects of mir15a5p on cc cells the present study cotransfected pcdnayap1 andor mir15a5p mimic as well as their controls into siha and c33a cells the overexpression efficiency was verified

overexpression of yap1 significantly abolished the inhibitory effects of mir15a5p upregulation on the viability of siha and c33a cells fig 6b the increased apoptosis induced by mir15a5p overexpression was also reversed by overexpression of yap1 fig 6c furthermore overexpression of yap1 significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of mir15a5p on cell invasion and migration fig 6d and e in addition it was identified that overexpression of yap1 alone significantly promoted cc cell viability inhibited cell apoptosis and enhanced the invasion and migration compared with blank control group

effective therapeutic strategy for cc in the present study based on microarray expression data it was identified that mir15a5p is one of the most markedly downregulated mirnas in cc tissues notably previous studies have reported that mir15a5p functions as a tumor suppressor in several human cancer types  although mir15a5p has been found to be downregulated in cc  to the best of our knowledge the

notably mir15a3p has also reported to exhibit differential expression and induce apoptosis in human cc cells  although the present study did not detect the expression change of mir15a3p in the

not shown however the role and regulatory mechanisms of mir15a3p on invasion and migration remain unclear the function of more mirnas in cc will be investigated in the futureprevious studies have reported that mir15a5p has the potential to suppress cell growth and inhibit the progression of human cancers by regulating its downstream target genes  for example luo    demonstrated that

and growth of colon cancer cells yu    demonstrated that knockdown of yap1 causes a significant inhibition of the growth and migration of renal cell carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo notably yap1 has been verified to target mir15a5p to suppress cell growth and metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma  and colon cancer  however whether yap1 is a target of mir15a5p in cc remains unclear in the present study yap1 was confirmed to be a target of mir15a5p and its protein expression levels were negatively regulated by mir15a5p further investigation indicated that yap1 was significantly increased in cc tissues and inversely correlated with mir15a5p in cc  tissues furthermore yap1 was confirmed to act as an oncogene gene in cc cells and its overexpression partly abrogated the inhibitory effect induced by enhanced expression of mir15a5p in cc cells taken together the present study demonstrates that mir15a5p exerts its tumor suppressive role in cc cells by targeting yap1due to the limitation in experimental conditions and funds further research in the future is required to investigate whether mir15a5p serves its role via other downstream targets in addition the present study investigated the cellular function of mir15a5p and its underlying mechanism in cc however in vivo studies and clinical trial data are required to validate the preliminary in vitro results obtained therefore the function of mir15a5p in cc needs to be further investigated in vivoin  conclusion  the  present  results  demonstrated  that mir15a5p suppresses the viability migration and invasion of cc cells by directly targeting yap1 based on these findings it is proposed that the mir15a5pyap1 axis may serve as a novel biomarker for new targets in cc therapyacknowledgementsnot

7508,Colon_Cancer,colorectal carcinoma crc as one of the most commongastrointestinal malignancies has developed the worldsfourth most deadly cancer with a high rate of incidence andmortality [ ] liver metastasis which is the most commonform for crc metastasis is the leading cause of high mortality for this severe malignancy   however few clinical prevention and treatment measures could be available for tumormetastasis therefore it is really urgent to develop new biomarkers and explore the underlying mechanism for crcmetastasis and eventually develop new therapeutic strategiesfor crc patientsduring cancer progression metabolic reprograming withincreasing glucose utilization is termed as warburg aï¬ectwhich is accompanied by altered pyruvate and mitochondrialmetabolism   the fate of pyruvate is the core manifestationto distinguish normal cells and tumor cells through metabolism in normal cells pyruvate was used for eï¬cient atpproduction directly into mitochondria however pyruvatewas converted into lactate in cytosol despite of normoxicand hypoxic conditions in cancer cells   this may be dueto the impaired process of pyruvate from the cytosol intothe mitochondrial matrix which is a critical metabolic steplinking glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation the mitochondrial pyruvate carriermpc a 0c  of immunology researchmultimeric complex containing two distinct proteins mpc1and mpc2 which is located in the inner mitochondrialmembrane is responsible for eï¬cient mitochondrial pyruvate uptake   loss of mpc expression or activity blockspyruvate entry into the tca cycle which results in a metabolism switch to increase glycolysis and the compensatoryusage of glutamine [ ]existed studies have reported that mpc1 was related withimmunoregulation stemness metabolism cellular morphology etc [ ] currently the important role of mpc1was uncovered in several tumors in crc and esophagealsquamous cell carcinoma decreased mpc1 results in accelerated aerobic glycolysis and malignant progression [ ] inlung adenocarcinoma mpc1 deï¬ciency accelerates lung adenocarcinoma progression through the stat3 pathway  in prostate cancer mpc1 was reported to be involved instemness and metabolism which regulated by couptfii[ ] in renal cell carcinoma hypoxiainduced loss ofmpc1 enhanced the expression of mmp7 and mmp9 to promote cell invasion   collectively these data suggestedthat mpc1 maybe serves as a suppressor to disrupt tumormalignancy however whether mpc1 is involved in crcmetastasis and the underlying mechanisms remain to beillustratedin the present study we ï¬gured out the relationshipbetween the mpc1 expression and crc liver metastasiswe identiï¬ed that decreased mpc1 was closely correlatedwith patients metastasis as well as led to poor prognosisfunctionally mpc1 overexpression could attenuate themigration and invasion capacities of crc cells both in vitroand in vivo mechanically mpc1 suppressed crc metastasisthrough mediating the wntcatenin signaling thus ourï¬nding ï¬rstly revealed a critical role of mpc1 in crc livermetastasis materials and methods data mining seven geo datasets gse21510 gse5206gse20916 gse9348

catenin previous reports showed that cytoplasmic catenin phosphorylated in nterminally localized to sites of cellcell contact isassociated with ecadherin and was required for intact cellcell adhesions without any change detected in the levels oftotal catenin [] simultaneously cellcell adhesionbased on cadherin binding with catenin limited wnt signals   in addition catenin was reported to interact

lymphoblastic leukemia cells   inhcc catenin was reported to interact with yap1 to leadto rapid tumorigenesis   hence it is reasonable to guessthat accumulated cytoplasmic catenin maybe crosstalkwith other genes or involved in other biological processeswhat is more some downstream target genes of cateninsuch as mmp7 ecadherin snail1 and myc were changedin expression as known to us mmp7 is a member of theproteolytic enzyme family which promotes the invasionand metastasis of tumor cells by degrading the basementmembrane and extracellular matrix   and previous studies had evidenced for involvement

moreover ecadherin was reportedto be involved in cellcell junction to regulate cancer invasionand metastasis [ ] and the gsea analysis also revealedthat mpc1 could aï¬ect the cellcell contacts data notshown as described previously mmp7 could facilitatemorphological transition by cleaving ecadherin   thecommunication between the cells is disrupted when ecadherin was shredded leading to destructed cell adhesionand induction of emt followed by increased cell migration  inspired by this we assumed that mpc1 could mediatetumor cell motility through aï¬ecting mmp7 activity cellcell 0c  of

7509,Colon_Cancer,"""   recent impressive advances in cancer immunotherapy have been largely derived from cellular immunity the role of humoral immunity in carcinogenesis has been less understood based on our previous observations we hypothesize that an immunoglobulin subtype igg4 plays an essential role in cancer immune evasionmethods  the distribution abundance actions properties and possible mechanisms of igg4 were investigated with human cancer samples and animal tumor models with an extensive array of techniques both in vitro and in vivoresults  in a cohort of patients with esophageal cancer we found that igg4 containing b lymphocytes and igg4 concentration were significantly increased in cancer tissue and igg4 concentrations increased in serum of patients with cancer both were positively related to increased cancer malignancy and poor prognoses that is more igg4 appeared to associate with more aggressive cancer growth we further found that igg4 regardless of its antigen specificity inhibited the classic immune reactions of antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis and complement dependent cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vitro and these effects were obtained through its fc fragment reacting to the fc fragments of cancer specific igg1 that has been bound to cancer antigens we also found that igg4 competed with igg1 in reacting to fc receptors of immune effector cells therefore locally increased igg4 in cancer microenvironment should inhibit antibody mediated anticancer responses and help cancer to evade local immune attack and indirectly promote cancer growth this hypothesis was verified in three different immune potent mouse models we found that local application of igg4 significantly accelerated growth of inoculated breast and colorectal cancers and carcinogen induced skin papilloma we also tested the antibody drug for cancer immunotherapy nivolumab which was igg4 in nature with a stabilizing s228p mutation and found that it significantly promoted cancer growth in mice this may provide an explanation to the newly appeared hyperprogressive disease sometimes associated with cancer immunotherapy  there appears to be a previously unrecognized immune evasion mechanism with igg4 playing an essential role in cancer microenvironment with implications in cancer diagnosis and immunotherapyintroductionwhile  new  immune  therapy  for  cancer focuses  mostly  on  manipulating  cellular immunity  humoral  immunity  also  holds great promise for cancer therapy1  igg4 is a unique antibody that has the lowest concentration  among  igg  subtypes  in  healthy individuals  and  its  function  has  not  been well understood3 igg4 was regarded as a blocking  antibody  because  of  its  reduced ability  to  trigger  effector  immune  reactions6  therefore whatever molecules igg4 reacts to the subsequent immune reaction was subdued8 igg4 has a unique structure of  fab  arm  exchange  fae  in  which  the two heavy and light chains of two different antibodies  with  different  specificities  are exchanged  resulting in  an  asymmetric bispecific  antibody  with  reduced  ability to  bind  to  antigen  and  to  form  immune complexes9 another unique feature of igg4 is  that  it  can  react  to  other  iggs  via  its  fc fragment and the significance of this property has not been well understood evidence suggests  that  fae  and  fc fc  reactivity  may involve  the  same  molecular  structure  on igg4  molecule10  davies  et  al11    resolved the  crystal  structure  of  igg4  fc  fragment revealing  a  unique  molecular  conformation  supporting  its  fc  binding  property recent  interests  in  igg4 related  diseases unveiled  a  wide  range  of  pathologies  with a common phenomenon of often increased igg4 concentration in the serum and igg4 postive  plasma  cells  in  the  affected  ans accompanied  by  local  inflammation  and fibrosis  but  its  pathogenic  mechanism  is still poorly understood13to cite wang a0h xu a0q zhao a0c et a0al  an immune evasion mechanism with igg4 playing an essential role in cancer and

performed on limited  number  of  cases  without  convincing  explanation of mechanism or significance wu  19 reported that  serum  igg4igg  ratio  could  predict  recurrence of  hepatocellular  carcinoma  after  surgery  the  most extensive study on igg4 and cancer was performed by karagiannis  20 who investigated the possible effect of  cancer specific  igg4  in  inhibiting  cancer  immunity in  melanomas  and  suggested  competition  between cancer specific  igg4  and  igg1  in  binding  to  cancer antigens as the cause for the inhibition a recent report raised the concept of cancer educated b cells and toxic igg produced by these cells in facilitating lymph node metastasis  for  breast  cancer  in  a  mouse  model21  we performed  a  multidimensional  investigation  of  igg4 in a wide array of patients with cancer and tissues with both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  experiments  extensive  new evidence  led  us  to  hypothesize  that  there  is  a  potent humoral immune editing mechanism in cancer microenvironment  with  igg4  playing  an  essential  role  we propose  that  fc fc  reaction  could  be  the  basic  mechanism  of  this  immune  inhibition  we  validated  this  in three immune potent animal models this property was also  found  applicable  to  cancer  immunotherapy  drug nivolumab which was igg4 in nature our study points to  a  so  far  little

7510,Colon_Cancer,"""   tumor associated macrophages tam constitute the most abundant immune cells in the tumor stroma initiating pro inflammatory m1 or immunosuppressive m2 responses depending on their polarization status advances in tumor immunotherapy call for a detailed understanding of potential immunogenic mechanisms of irradiation routinely applied in rectal cancer patientsmethods  to test the effects of radiotherapy on tam we ex vivo irradiated tissue samples of human rectal cancer and assessed the phenotype by flow cytometry we furthermore evaluated the distribution of leucocyte subsets in tissue sections of patients after short course radiotherapy and compared findings to non pretreated rectal cancer using an immunostaining approach anotypic assays ota consisting of macrophages cancer associated fibroblast and cancer cell lines were used to dissect the immunological consequences of irradiation in macrophagesresults  we demonstrate that short course neoadjuvant radiotherapy in rectal cancer patients is associated with a shift in the polarization of tam towards an m1 like pro inflammatory phenotype in addition ex vivo irradiation caused an increase in the phagocytic activity and enhanced expression of markers associated with stimulatory signals necessary for t cell activation in ota we observed that this alteration in macrophage polarization could be mediated by extracellular vesicles ev derived from irradiated tumor cells we identified high mobility group box  in ev from irradiated tumor cells as a potential effector signal in that crosstalks  our findings highlight macrophages as potential effector cells upon irradiation in rectal cancer by diminishing their immunosuppressive phenotype and activate pro inflammation our data indicate that clinically applied short term radiotherapy for rectal cancer may be exploited to stimulate immunogenic macrophages and suggest to target the polarization status of macrophages to enhance future immunotherapeutic strategiesintroductionsince  the  introduction  of  immune  checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has become an attractive therapeutic option in cancer1 irradiation  used  as  standard  therapy  in a  number  of  solid  malignancies  induces immunogenic cell death icd by the release of  damage associated  pattern  damp4 studies  based  on  murine  models  indicated that  irradiation

anticancer therapies22  there are conflicting results  with  respect  to  the  effect  of  irradiation  on  the macrophage  phenotype  klug  et  al  demonstrated  in  a murine  model  of  breast  cancer  and  human  pancreatic cancer that low dose irradiation  gy induced repolarization of m2 like macrophages to m1 like macrophages via  induction  of  nitric  oxide  synthase  inos24  moreover  expression  of  inos  correlated  with  vessel  normalization and an influx of cd8 t cells suggesting a tumor ablative as well as pro inflammatory effect of repolarized macrophages upregulation of inos was also observed in murine  prostate  cancer  which  has  been  irradiated  with up to  gy25 similarly agonists of the toll like receptor further stimulated the m1 phenotype of macrophages and enhanced the antitumor effects of irradiation in a murine model  of  breast  cancer26  other  studies  suggested  that irradiation of tumors was associated with a more immunosuppressive phenotype of tam27 jones   found that the  depletion  of  macrophages  by  an  anti csf  antibody greatly  increased  tumor  ablation  upon  irradiation   gy  in  murine  tumors  generated  from  a  colorectal  and a pancreatic cell line obviously the effect of irradiation appears to depend on the model irradiation dose tissue as well as on the investigated time point after irradiation however despite the controversial reports an important role for tam in response to radiotherapy seems evidentmore recently extracellular vesicles ev have attracted attention in mediating signals to immune cells ev are rich in molecular cargos and are emerging as critical messengers in the cell to cell crosstalk they contain a variety of small signaling molecules which can be transferred to other cell types to modulate cell functions30 thus we hypothesized that  ev  might  be  involved  in  macrophages  regulation  in the  tumor  microenvironment  in  irradiated  cells  using  a clinically relevant

and  low  levels  of  the  chemokine  receptor  ccr7  indicating  that  the  m2 like  macrophage  phenotype  was  present  in  untreated  rectal  cancer figure 1e this was also reflected in their

untreated  samples  in  contrast  ex  vivo  application  of    gy  Î³irradiation  to  primary  rectal  cancer  leucocytes resulted in a reduced presence of cd163 tam this phenotype correlated with enhanced levels of tnfÎ± and inos tam as well as diminished detection of il10 and il13  tam  hence  low dose  irradiation  of  rectal  cancer tissue  can  polarize  tam  towards  a  pro inflammatory

7511,Colon_Cancer,"""   triple negative breast cancer tnbc remains recalcitrant to most targeted therapy approaches however recent clinical studies suggest that inducing tumor damage can render tnbc responsive to immunotherapy we therefore tested a strategy for immune sensitization of murine tnbc 4t1 tumors through combination of focused ultrasound fus thermal ablation and a chemotherapy gemcitabine gem known to attenuate myeloid derived suppressor cells mdscsmethods  we applied a sparse scan thermally ablative fus regimen at the tumor site in combination with systemically administered gem we used flow cytometry analysis to investigate the roles of monotherapy and combinatorial therapy in mediating local and systemic immunity we also tested this combination in rag1 mice or t cell depleted wild type mice to determine the essentiality of adaptive immunity further we layered programmed cell death protein  pd1 blockade onto this combination to evaluate its impact on tumor outgrowth and survivalresults  the immune modulatory effect of fus monotherapy was insufficient to promote a robust t cell response against 4t1 consistent with the dominant mdsc driven immunosuppression evident in this model the combination of fusgem significantly constrained primary tnbc tumor outgrowth and extended overall survival of mice tumor control correlated with increased circulating antigen experienced t cells and was entirely dependent on t cell mediated immunity the ability of fusgem to control primary tumor outgrowth was moderately enhanced by either neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with anti pd1  thermally ablative fus in combination with gem restricts primary tumor outgrowth improves survival and enhances immunogenicity in a murine metastatic tnbc model this treatment strategy promises a novel option for potentiating the role of fus in immunotherapy of metastatic tnbc and is worthy of future clinical evaluationtrial registration numbers  nct03237572 and nct04116320 metastatic breast cancer brca particularly the  triple negative  breast  cancer  tnbc phenotype is resistant to most chemical and molecularly targeted therapeutic approaches interestingly  tnbc  is  often  infiltrated  with immune cells and the presence of these cells has been shown to have a favorable prognosis in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy1 early studies in the use of immunotherapies  targeting  the  pd1programmed death ligand    pd l1  checkpoint  inhibitory  axis  showed  some  efficacy2  in  tnbc compared  with  other  brca  subtypes  which are  generally  recalcitrant  to  checkpoint blockade activity in the tnbc subtype may be related to the relatively high immune infiltration and correlated with the higher mutational  burden  observed  in  tnbc  greater immunotherapy  efficacy  in  tnbc  has  been recently observed with the use of antibodies targeting the pd1pd l1 checkpoint inhibitory axis in combination with nab paclitaxel5 this  outcome  suggests  that  inducing  tumor damage  augments  antitumor immunity either  by  promoting  antigen  availability  or disrupting  the  immunosuppressive  tumor microenvironment tme found in tnbcamong  the  potential  networks  in  tnbc that could constrain the activity of antitumor immunity  is  the  presence  of  immunosuppressive  myeloid  cell  subsets  these  have the  capacity  to  impair  adaptive  immunity and  promote  tumor  growth  and  metastasis among  these  cell  types  myeloid derived suppressor cells mdscs prevail as a heterogeneous  population  of  immature  myeloid cells  which  serve  the  eponymous  role  of suppressing the antitumor immune response limiting  both  t  cell  activation  and  effector functions6  increased levels of this cell type have been demonstrated in tumor tissues of patients with primary brca while those with metastatic  disease  bear  the  highest  abundance  of  circulating  mdscs8  studies  have sheybani a0nd et a0al j immunother cancer 20208e001008 101136jitc2020001008 0copen access shown that approaches that either stimulate myeloid cells with  inflammatory  mediators  or  eliminate  mdsc  can improve antitumor immunity9to this end the central premise put forth in this study is that focused ultrasound fusa safe noninvasive and nonionizing strategy for localized acoustic energy deposition  into  tissuescan  synergize  with  immunotherapy in a murine model of metastatic tnbc fus is capable of rapidly heating tumors to thermally ablative temperatures its extracorporeal application obviates the need for catheterization  injection  or  implantation  fus  can  be targeted  with  millimeter  precision  under  mri  or  ultrasound  guidance  thereby  allowing  for  thermal  damage and  destruction  of  tumor  tissue  without  compromising healthy intervening or peripheral tissues the bioeffects of fus hold distinct implications for tumor antigenicity immune  cell  activation  and  trafficking13    thermally active  fus  regimes  have  elicited  antitumor  immune responses in implantable models of melanoma15 pancreatic16  prostate17  colon20  kidney21    and  brca23 pertaining  to  the  challenge  of  myeloid  cell  immunosuppression  in  tnbc  thermally  ablative  fus  has  been shown to induce the expression of heat shock proteins24  and proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin  il12 interferonÎ ifnÎ and tumor necrosis factorÎ± tnfÎ±  from  a  variety  of  cancer  cell  lines  and  after  in vivo treatment of tumors26  whether the ability of fus to  induce  these  inflammatory  mediators  is  sufficient  to overcome myeloid suppression in the context of brca is currently under debate with some studies showing activation of antigen presenting cells and t cell recruitment in  patients  with  brca  treated  with  thermally  ablative fus28  while others show that additional innate stimuli are needed to support antitumor immunity23  notably some  studies  have  suggested  that  a  sparse scan  thermal ablation  regimen  more  effectively  recruits  and  activates dendritic cells dcs and antitumor immunity than total thermal  ablation  perhaps  by  limiting  thermal  denaturation of tumor antigens and innate stimuli31based  on  the  improved  myeloid  cell  maturation  that occurs  with  sparse scan  regimens  we  herein  tested  the ability  of  a  sparse scan  partial  thermal  ablation  fus regimen as a monotherapy to promote antitumor immunity  in  an  aggressive  syngeneic  model  of  metastatic murine tnbc with extensive granulocytic mdsc involvement that is recalcitrant to anti pd1 while some activity is  evident  with  the  partial  ablation  approach  significantly  greater  control  was  achieved  by  targeting  mdsc inhibition  in  combination  with  thermally  ablative  fus this control was completely dependent on the adaptive immune responsemoreover  we  demonstrate  that  layering  anti pd1 immune  checkpoint  blockade  onto  this  combinatorial regimen  moderately  improves  tumor  growth  restriction  these  data  suggest  that  in  disease  settings  where myeloid allied approaches  to  attenuate  myeloid  immunosuppression may be employed to reveal the full immunotherapeutic immunosuppression  predominates potential  of  thermally  ablative  fus  once  immunosuppressive myeloid cells are accounted for

response to monotherapy and  combination  therapy  may  contribute  to  tumor control but are unlikely to drive the protective response entirely interestingly intratumoral t cell representation correlates poorly with circulating lymphocytes suggesting a transitory immune response that either cannot be fully characterized at this time point or is hampered by additional modes of immunosuppressionprotection conferred by combination of fus and gem is dependent on adaptive immunitysince  our  findings  revealed  no  obvious  advantage  or function of adaptive immunity in the

inhibition offered by fusgem was entirely lost in  rag1  mice  relative  to  their  wt  counterparts  with average  4t1  tumor  volume  in  rag1  mice  being  over fivefold higher than that of wt mice on termination of treatments figure 5a of note despite a trend toward loss  of  protection  in  rag1  mice  tumor  outgrowth  in response  to  gem  monotherapy  did  not  significantly stratify  between  wt  and  rag1  settings  figure  5a we also observed a complete loss of fusgem mediated survival  benefit  over  gem  monotherapy  in  the  rag1 setting figure 5b while these results demonstrate that an intact adaptive immune response is required for both the  overall  survival  benefit  and  restriction  of  primary tumor offered by fusgem therapy they do not delineate the relative roles of t andor b cellsthus to address the hypothesis that the protective effect of fusgem is specifically dependent on cd4 and cd8 t cells we depleted these populations via serial coinjections of cd8 depleting and cd4 depleting antibodies in 4t1 tumor bearing wt mice on a fusgem   figure  5c  depletions  were  maintained  between  day  and day  and flow cytometry

7512,Colon_Cancer,"""   adenovirus serotype  ad5 is a commonly used viral vector for transient delivery of transgenes primarily for vaccination against pathogen and tumor antigens however endemic infections with ad5 produce virus specific neutralizing antibodies nabs that limit transgene delivery and constrain target directed immunity following exposure to ad5 based vaccines indeed clinical trials have revealed the limitations that virus specific nabs impose on the efficacy of ad5 based vaccines in that context the emerging focus on immunological approaches targeting cancer self antigens or neoepitopes underscores the unmet therapeutic need for more efficacious vaccine vectorsmethods  here we evaluated the ability of a chimeric adenoviral vector ad5f35 derived from the capsid of ad5 and fiber of the rare adenovirus serotype  ad35 to induce immune responses to the tumor associated antigen guanylyl cyclase c gucy2cresults  in the absence of pre existing immunity to ad5 gucy2c specific t cell responses and antitumor efficacy induced by ad5f35 were comparable to ad5 in a mouse model of metastatic colorectal cancer furthermore like ad5 ad5f35 vector expressing gucy2c was safe and produced no toxicity in tissues with or without gucy2c expression importantly this chimeric vector resisted neutralization in ad5 immunized mice and by sera collected from patients with colorectal cancer naturally exposed to ad5s  these data suggest that ad5f35 based vaccines targeting gucy2c or other tumor or pathogen antigens may produce clinically relevant immune responses in more ¥ patients compared with ad5 based vaccines inhibitor introductiontherapies immune  checkpoint have  revolutionized  cancer  treatment  and cancer  drug  development  by  engaging  the immune  system  to  target  various  cancers1   despite this success many tumors are immunologically cold characterized by a dearth of  immunogenic  neoepitopes3  and  lack  of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes4  and remain refractory  to  checkpoint  inhibitors6    one emerging strategy to modify a cold tumor into one responsive to immunotherapy is through combination  with  cancer  vaccines8    the goal of this strategy is to use cancer vaccines to create a pool of tumor reactive t cells with antitumor  activity  alone  andor  in  combination  with  checkpoint  therapies  however this  approach  is  significantly  limited  by  the paucity of effective vaccine platforms to safely deliver tumor specificassociated antigens to elicit beneficial antitumor immunitythe  ability  of  adenovirus  serotype   ad5  to  mediate  gene  transfer  and  induce potent  immune  responses  has  made  it  a popular  vector  for  experimental  vaccines infectious  diseases10 against  cancer  and indeed there have been more than  clinical  trials  using  the  ad5  vector  with  most trials  focused  on  developing  cancer  treatments10    however  on  natural  infection the  host  immune  system  develops  neutralizing  antibodies  nabs  to  the  ad5  capsid limiting  viral  spread  and  blocking  reinfection  because  ad5  infections  are  endemic in  many  human  populations  pre existing nabs  present  in    of  the  worldwide population  limit  ad5 based  vaccine  strategies12  these  considerations  highlight  the need for improved vectors for use in vaccines targeting  cancer  and  pathogen associated antigens that can create therapeutic immune responses in the greatest number of patients importantly  while  the  adenovirus  capsid is  composed  of  hexon  penton  and  fiber proteins nabs elicited by natural ad5 infection in humans are directed primarily to the ad5  fiber15    suggesting  that  strategies  to flickinger jr a0jc et a0al j immunother cancer 20208e001046

severe that it can lead to a disproportionate and mortal reaction of the immune system known as a cytokine storm all of these factors make covid19 highly unpredictable it is what specialists call a multisystem disease  0caround the world cases of liver dysfunction denoted by elevated hepatic enzymes in serum such as ast aspartate aminotransferase and alt alanine transaminase have been documented among patients infected with sarscov2 there is still no certainty whether the covid19related liver damagedysfunction is due mainly to the viral replication per se drugs toxicity or other coexisting comorbidities   whether sexrelated difference could help to explain why infected men are more healthy or harmful relationship between the liver and its viral aggressor in this paper we describe a

general the incidence of increased liver biochemical markers in hospitalized patients with covid19 mainly ast and alt and slightly elevated bilirubin varies between  to  of cases   the increase in liver enzymes is there are no reports of acute or subacute liver failure in patients with covid19 the largest cohort study that included  cases of covid19 from china showed that   had preexisting chronic liver disease lei and colleagues reported that impaired  liver  function  was  related  to  mortality  in  covid19  patients   elevated ast was more frequent  and significant than the increase of alt  in severe  0chospitalized patients moreover elevated ast was shown to be associated with highest mortality risk   in the study reported by yijin wang     they found that  of   covid patients had elevated ast activity the median levels of alt were  ul vs  ul respectively ast were  ul vs  ul respectively in abnormal and normal aminotransferase groups liver enzymes abnormality were associated with disease severity protein levels in addition they found by ultrastructural examination of coronavirus ps in hepatocytes in covid19 cases sarscov2 infected hepatocytes displayed as well as a series of laboratory tests including higher alveolararterial oxygen gradient aado2 higher gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ggt lower albumin and lower total conspicuous mitochondrial swelling

immunosuppressed population coronavirus the interaction of its proteins with cellular proteins and consequently the immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune hepatitis aih developing covid19 taken together both ultrastructural and histological evidence indicated a typical lesion of viral infection   all these findings by different reports demonstrates that sarscov2 infection in liver is a crucial cause of hepatic impairment in covid19 patients however alteration of cellular metabolism that give rise to systematic alterations and metabolic report from alessio gerussi    demonstrated that patients under today the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are altered by infection with this changes are still unknown   0cmolecular biology of sarscov2 coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that contain a positively polarized unsegmented rna genome belonging to the coronaviridae family and the order of nidovirales they are distributed in humans and other mammals  the size of the sarscov2 virions is approximately  to  nm in diameter [] sarscov2 has a genome that consists polymerase rdrp which is nsp12 and is responsible of the replication and transcription of the virus  which are encoded by the various genetic loci on the genome   at the center of the virion lies a nucleocapsid composed of the genomic rna and the nucleocapsid protein  the virus glycoprotein s consists of two subunits s1 which is at the amino terminus and that encodes for structural proteins and a larger region that encodes two open reading frames orf 1a and 1b which together encode for the nonstructural virus proteins from nucleocapsid protein which is within the phospholipid bilayer and nonstructural proteins nsp1 to nsp16  the virions have a structural sspike protein outer spiky glycoprotein mmembrane protein a type iii transmembrane glycoprotein nof   nucleotides   encoding  amino acids and it is composed of a region   preproofvirus   as well as protein m which is a type iii transmembrane glycoprotein  and  participates in the cellular membrane rearrangements for the replication and transcription complexes  among the encoded proteins is an rnadependent rna provides the receptor binding site and s2 which is at the carboxyl terminus responsible for membrane fusion   the envelope protein e has a role in the assembly and release of the nonstructural proteins have several functions during de viral cycle for example nsp    0cthe virus enters the cell by endocytosis through the interaction between envelope glycoprotein s with the cell receptor ace2 and with the participation of the type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2   once it enters the cell the n protein with viral genome are released within the cytoplasm then cellular proteases degrade the capsid and the virus genome is left free next the polyprotein containing the viral proteins that are how does the virus select which cells to infect viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only permissive cells within that host permissive cells make all the necessary proteins and viral factors to allow virus to replicate once a virus gets inside a cell it hijacks the cellular processes to produce virally encoded proteins that will replicate the viruss genetic material  viral replication may cause exocytosis  will translate into viral proteins this entire process will occur in the cell cytoplasm the processed to form the replication complex is translated and then the complementary strand of negative sense pregenomic rna is synthesized to be used as a template to replicate the structural proteins that will be synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to assembly the viral p and finish the cycle through the release of the viruses by positive sense viral genome  furthermore the replication and transcription complex will lead to a series of smaller positive sense subgenomic rnas these are the ones that   preproofboth sarscov  and the new sarscov2 are very similar in structure and pathogenicity but the major structural protein s protein is slightly different between them  compared to other beta coronaviruses the presence of a furinlike cleavage site in sarscov2 enables the s protein priming and facilitates an increase on the efficiency of the spread of sarscov2 as is reported wide world    0cbiochemical changes producing cell damage called cytopathic effects like other coronaviruses sarscov2 requires cellular receptors to initiate its internalization to the cells that carry these factors  li    sarscov2 uses the angiotensinconverting enzyme  ace2 as a host cell receptor sarscov2 spike s protein binds ace2 with significantly high affinity  in addition the main host protease that suggested to promote the pathogenesis of this coronavirus    program httpsportalgdccancergov they compared ace2 expression levels across  human tissues between males and females and between younger and older persons in these individual tissues furthermore other reports have analyzed the correlations between ace2 in order to provide insights into the mechanism of sarscov2 infection li      analyzed  the expression of ace2 in various normal human tissues using the datasets from the genotypetissue expression gtex project  and the cancer genome atlas tcga transmembrane serine protease  other host proteases such as furin have also been mediates sprotein activation on primary target cells and initial viral entry is the type ii   preproofreported by li   ace2 expression levels showed no significant difference between have no significant association with sex age or race  is the liver a direct target for sarscov2 males and females between younger and older persons or between asian and nonasian races this finding suggests that the infection risk of sarscov2 and sarscov may expression levels and immune signature enrichment levels in individual tissues  as as we expected because the systemic manifestations of covid19 it has been reported that sarscov2 has an anotropism beyond the respiratory tract including the kidneys  0cliver heart and brain and possibly that anotropism influences the course of covid19 disease and aggravates preexisting conditions the ace2 protein is found at high levels in the gi tract as the colon biliary system and liver   on the other hand it is well documented a sarscov2 rna shedding in the gi tract    supporting its  tropism for architecture express ace   tmprss1  receptors    the presence of these two host factors in the liver suggests that a direct viral cytopathic effect occurs also in sars infection the presence of viral rna in liver tissue was documented but not as extensively as the new coronavirus data published by gordon    suggest that mitochondrial proteins interact directly with the virus which helps to understand the potential mechanism by which elevated ast the gi tract and liver cells and these may be sites of active viral replication and either direct or indirect tissue injury indeed a large part of the cells distributed in the liver   preproofeffect the exacerbated inflammatory response in covid19 may play a central role in profiles are detected in these patients   furthermore in addition to this intracellular more recently   identified the clinical and laboratory characteristics of covid19 patients with abnormal liver transaminases and they reported that sarscov2 is able to which high levels of il6 have been reported   which are involved in both infect liver cells and cause liver impairment by direct cytopathic effect  inflammatory and repair responses in liver disease    mechanisms of liver pathogenicity   0cif sarscov2 replication has direct adverse effects on liver function it is still unknown findings in liver biopsy of patients killed by covid19 showed moderate micro vesicular steatosis and mild portal and necroinflammatory activity  this seems to indicate that a direct injury occurred while the infection that could have been directly caused by sarscov2 another possibility is that a druginduced liver injury occurred to date there are the following possible mechanisms figure  infection the massive release of cytokines by the immune system in response to the viral infection can result in a cytokine storm and symptoms of sepsis that are the cause of death in  of fatal covid19 cases   in these cases uncontrolled inflammation induces multian damage leading including liver failure biomarkers of inflammation such as creactive protein pcr serum ferritin ldh ddimer il6 il2 are have been found to be significantly elevated in   immune damage from exacerbated inflammation in response to sarscov2   preproofpathogenesis of sars cov related liver disease more studies should be liver is a potential target for direct infection with this virus to understand the performed for evidence of viral mechanisms of replication in different cell anelles as cytoplasm endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus and lipidrafts

efficiently produce both infectious and defective non 0cinfective whole virions there are not yet enough data to know the viral dynamics in the different tissues and the associated pathogenesis  anoxia respiratory failure is one of the main characteristics of covid19 anoxic hypoxic hepatitis is common in patients with severe symptoms    reactivation of preexisting liver disease patients with preexisting chronic liver medications such as tocilizumab and baricitinib used to combat the adverse immune cholestatic liver disease various studies such as lopinavir  ritonavir remdesivir chloroquine tocilizumab uminefovir  traditional chinese medicine so it is important to consider that they could be potentially hepatotoxic in some patients    druginduced liver damage dili initial clinical guidelines recommended antiviral agents for covid19 so a variety of drugs have been administered in disease may be more susceptible to liver damage from sarscov2 biological   preproof genetic factors genetics may well be one of the determining factors in some reaction may also cause hbv reactivation   and induce eventual impairment of liver function in those patients with hbv on the other hand it is still unknown whether sarscov2 infection exacerbates cholestasis in people with underlying patients who become seriously ill with covid19 but until now we cannot be sure it is possible for example that the genetic variation that makes an individual more susceptible to high blood pressure or diabetes also makes him more vulnerable to the virus it will be important to find out what role genetic factors predisposing to liver steatosis have and their sensitivity to severe symptoms of covid19 ji and  0ccolleagues showed that subjects with metabolicassociated fatty liver disease mafld have a higher risk of covid19 severity disease and abnormal liver blood tests than patients without mafld   in contrast  louise biquard      demonstrated that mafld is not associated with changes in liver expression blood test abnormalities reported by ji and colleagues is thus likely not explained by  concluding remarks the scenario is not yet complete which does not allow us to establish or understand the natural history of the disease and the participation or commitment of the liver in this disease certainly the application of new technological platforms such as singlecell increased

7514,Colon_Cancer,""" ethnopharmacological  relevance  herba  patriniae  has  been  used  for  thousands  of years in china as a traditional chinese medicine with heatclearing and detoxicating effects  it  is  applied  widly  for  the  treatment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  diarrhea  acute hepatitis  pelvic  inflammatory  disease  and  ulcerative  colitis  in  clinic  two  species namely  patrinia

flavonoids anic acids irids and volatiles a very distinct difference was observed that ps is rich in triterpenoid saponins and volatiles while pv  contains  more  flavonoids  two  source  species  of  herba  patriniae  gave  similar pharmacological effects on anticancer antiinflammatory antioxidant antimicrobial sedative  and  hypnotic  effects  but  there  were  no  reports  were  on  antipruritic proangiogenic and antidiarrheal effects for ps and no studies on antidiabetic effects for  pv  generally  herba  patriniae  showed  nontoxic  in  the  clinical  dose  but  mild side  effects  such  as  temporary  leukopenia  dizziness  and  nausea  could  be  found when  large  and  excessive  dosage  is  used  a  variety  of  compounds  have  been quantified  for  the  quality  control  of  ps

7515,Colon_Cancer,"""melatonin is a sleepregulating hormone created by the pineal glandand is released at night   it has been found to have biological activityin almost all living anisms including plants animals and microbes itcan quickly enter cells through the bilipid bilayer and exhibit scavenging activity towards oxygen free radicals as well as antioxidant properties due to its low molecular weight and amphiphilic nature  peripheral tissues have been found to show a high afï¬nity towardsthis hormone melatonin and hence act on receptors and bindingsites   studies reported by tan   show that melatonin can alsobe produced in the mitochondria and hence tissue melatonin levelsare more than that of serum levels hence can be used as a moleculethat targets mitochondria   the main physicochemical and biologicalproperties of melatonin are sleepinducing effects   antioxidant behavior [] antiammatory activity [] antiapoptotic effects  and neuroprotective   effects it also

melatonin chemically nacetyl5methoxytryptamine is a tryptophan derivative has multiplephysiological effects and can be used to treat many diseases related tovirus infections especially respiratory diseases in covid19 patientswith digestive complications melatonin has positive effects   0cn alzaqri      of molecular liquids   melatonin can thus be used as an adjunctive or even as a regular therapyas no antiviral treatment is currently available electrochemical measurements of melatonin overï¬ow demonstrate that melatonin secretiondecreases with age   melatonin treatments result in the enhancement of essential oil production in salvia species  in the context of the recent covid pandemic melatonin can beresearched as a potential molecule to control the dangerous effect ofthis disease rising patients' tolerance and decreasing the mortality infatal virus infections would control the innate immune response and reduce ammation during this period melatonin is a molecule with respective properties as it decreases the overreaction of the innateimmune response and overshoots ammation but also facilitatesadaptive immune function  even though melatonin is a critical biomolecule few works havebeen reported on the electronic structure and reactivity of this moleculeexcept for a preliminary work reported by turjanski and coworkers in using semiempirical methods   in this manuscript we describe a detailed investigation into the quantum mechanical propertiesof melatonin its spectral features reactivity preferences and the resultsof docking studies with three known structural protein receptors of thenovel coronavirus2 we found that melatonin docks strongly with thethree proteins we hypothesise that this compound can be used as anadjuvant medicine for the treatment of covid19 also significant restby a person peacefully sleeping in dark surroundings will enhance theproduction of this hormone which could help in the management ofcurrent patients or as a preventive measure in the vulnerablepopulation material and methodsthe melatonin molecule was optimised using the gaussian09  software package with the dftb3lyp functional and the 6311g 2dp basis set b3lyp is a commonly used functional and 63112dpbasis set is mediumsized basis set with diffused functions over heavyatoms and polarization functions to bring accuracy we performed frequency calculations to ensure that no imaginary frequency exists suchthat the geometry determined would correspond to a global minimumfor reaching the optimised geometry we used the same geometry for calculating frontier molecular analysis natural bonding orbitals and nonlinear optical studies for uvvisible spectrum simulation we usedtimedependent density functional theory tddft with longrangecorrected camb3lyp functionals with 6311g 2dp as the basis setbecause electronic transitions are timedependent phenomena tddftcalculations are done using the optimised geometry obtained fromb3lyp6311g2dp simulations the frontier molecular orbitals wereviewed from the checkpoint ï¬le generated during the optimisation calculations a wavefunction ï¬le was generated during a single

7516,Colon_Cancer,""" inhibiting suchtarget protein reduces the virulence of pathogens and reduces thetherapeutic resistance in the case of cancer we first come to the basicunderstanding of the role of grp78 in healthy and diseased cells grp78 in normal versus stressed cellunder normal conditions grp78 is found bound to three essentialenzymes that regulate cell growth differentiation apoptosis and signaling [] these enzymes are activating transcription factor atf6 protein kinase rnalike endoplasmic reticulum kinase perkand inositolrequiring enzyme  ire1 which are inactivated throughbinding to grp78 in the er lumen under the pressure of unfoldedproteins in the er grp78 releases atf6 perk and ire1 and theenzymes are activated once activated the enzymes atf6 perk andire1 upregulate transcription of chaperones inhibit the translationand enhance protein folding endoplasmic reticulum assisted degradation erad and other function that have been reviewed byothers [] see also fig  if the pressure of the unfolded proteins is not relieved the upr will direct part of the er to autophagyerphagy if it is not enough the whole cell will undergo apoptosis[]on the other hand under the

then again translocated to the nucleus and helps in upregulating chaperones such as grp78 perk inhibitsthe translation and protein synthesis while ire1 enhances the folding and erad under the pressure of the unfolded proteins the grp78 escapes the er retention andtranslocate to the cytoplasm and the cell membrane csgrp78 is subjected to the recognition of pathogenic proteins spike and envelope viral protein and coatproteins of fungi for interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this csgrp78 fig    this csgrp78 characterizes many aggressive types of cancers such as breast ovarian pancreatic and coloncancers [] additionally csgrp78 was reported to facilitate pathogenic entry both viral and fungal infections zika viruszikv dengue virus denv hepatitis c virus hcv human papilloma virus hpv ebola virus ebov middleeast respiratorysyndrome coronavirus mers cov japanese encephalitis virus jevcoxsackievirus a9 and borna disease virus bdv are among viralinfections that reported grp78 association with viral proteins andgrp78 upregulation in infected cells [] additionally recentstudies hypothesized the association of csgrp78 with the spike protein of sarscov2 to help in virus attachment and host cell entry  the primary binding viral protein to grp78 is spike proteins in coronaviruses and envelope proteins for the other viruses [] besidesthe spore coat protein homolog coth3 of rhizopus oryzae the causative fungus for mucormycosis is reported to bind to csgrp78 on endothelial cells and the binding is responsible for adherence and invasionof the fungus  since the association of the viral or pathogen infection and elevatedlevels of csgrp78 expression researchers are focused on targetinggrp78 to prevent or even weaken the pathogenic infection reducingthe concentration of grp78 over the cell membrane would reduce thenumber of internalized pathogenic ps and hence reduce the infection additionally when we target csgrp78 the pathogen virulence would be diminished at the same time cancerassociated resistance would also be dimensioned which becomes of the highestpriorities in dual diseases such as viral or fungal infections in cancerpatients grp78 associated radio and chemoresistancechemoresistance is the resistance of a tumor to chemotherapy itwas an old observation while the mechanism of grp78inducedchemoresistance in cancer cells was not fully understood   twomechanisms may be responsible for the chemoresistance the upr prosurvival branch and the receptormediated activation of the aktpi3kphosphoinositide 3kinase pathway   alternatively the proapoptotic action of the upr could be compensated by the activation ofthe aktpi3k pathway resulting in cell survival the extracellular loopof cleft lip and palate transmembrane 1like clptm1l is essentialfor gemcitabine resistance and interaction with grp78   additionally natural products such as isoliquiritigenin a chalconetypeflavonoid were able to reduce the chemoresistance and colonyformingability of oral squamous cell carcinomas   it is reported that theprior treatment of acidic stress protects the human dermal microvascular endothelial cells from apoptosis by reduced the cleavage ofcaspase  which was supposed to be due to the presence of grp78 onthe membrane of er that suppress caspase  activation  nonsmallcell lung cancer nsclc and glioblastoma multiformegbm have a low survival rate the overexpressed grp78 on the cellsurface is the primary reason for the radioresistance in nsclc andgbm   targeting cellsurface grp78 enhances the apoptosis andreduces cell proliferation colony formation and downregulates thecrucialintracellular phosphatidylinositol3kinaseprotein kinase bmammalian target

administration in mice  in breast cancer grp78 is overexpressed while the amount of cellsurface grp78 is increased upon the treatment with the antiangiogenicfactor combretastatin a4p   additionally cancer cells treated withdoxorubicin showed less resistance when treated with grp78 neutralizing antibodies [] generally elevated levels of grp78 areindicative of cancer aggressivity targeting cancer

compounds show binding affinity to csgrp78 once bound to a substrate the csgrp78 will be internalized tothe cell hence the concentration of the membranebound grp78 willbe reduced once the level of grp78 over the cell surface is droppedthe pathogens will not be able to enter the host cell through grp78hence the virulence will be reduced the inhibitory molecules that cantarget csgrp78 include phytochemicals peptides and antibodies andwill be discussed in detail in the next sections the inhibitors competewith the pathogen recognizing proteins such as spike envelope orcoat proteins for the csgrp78 substratebinding domain  this domain of the grp78 is reported to be responsible for the binding ofgrp78 to unfolded proteins inside the lumen of the er through itshydrophobic batches   phytochemicalsphytochemicals are compounds found in plants and have a varietyof effects on protein function   they are derived from fruits vegetables beans grains and some other plants   phytochemicalshave a protective role because their antioxidant characteristics whichplay a vital role in the protection of cells against oxidative damage anddecreasing the probability of cancer

access toppis varies across marketsin a resourceconstrained world the ability to predict need for interventions would seem more helpful than predictingendoscopic appearance although hrs are linked to

7519,Colon_Cancer,"""   preproofsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sarscov2 is a highly contagious zoonotic pathogen that has exacted heavy public health social and economic tolls in february  the world health anization acronymed the disease caused by sarscov2 as covid19 for coronavirus disease  the number of confirmed covid19 infections which has been detected in at least  countries has reached  worldwide as of april   with  deaths according to the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc1  many cases of covid19 resolve quickly however the disease which like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets infection with covid19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death this is particularly the case for cancer patients moreover because the signs and symptoms of covid are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself such as pulmonary embolism or its treatment such as nausea and diarrhea diagnosis may be delayed or missed potential covid rule out criteria based on the wells criteria for pulmonary embolism another protean disease entity are provided as a decisionmaking aid this review summarizes the current understanding of the transmission clinical presentation diagnosis and differential diagnosis pathogenesis rationale to treat the cancer or not treatment and prevention of covid19 with an emphasis on implications in cancer  keywords covid19 sarscov2 cancer introduction sarscov2 the rna virus responsible for the illness which has been named covid19 for coronavirus disease2019 the year it was diagnosed has sent shockwaves and dominated the news cycle due to its pandemic spread from the point of origin in wuhan china to the rest of the world declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health anization who2 sarscov2 is the third highly pathogenic novel zoonotic bat coronavirus sonamed because of the crownlike spikes on its surface to have emerged the first was sars coronavirus now named sarscov1 in  with a fatality rate of  and    0c   preproofthe second was middle east respiratory syndrome mers in  with a fatality rate of  where the camel was the intermediate host3 sarscov1 merscov and sarscov2 belong to the betacoronavirus genus which are enveloped positivestranded rna viruses whose approximately  nucleotide genome serves as an mrna template for the translation of viral proteins4 the virion contains four proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid and the host receptor with which the spike surface glycoprotein of sarscov2 engages is angiotensin converting enzyme  ace25 the biology of sarscov2 is described in more detail in figure  a zinc metallopeptidase enzyme ace2 which is abundantly present in lung and gastrointestinal epithelial cells6 not only mediates viral entry through receptormediated endocytosis7 but also the efficiency of viral replication8 its expression is upregulated with older age smoking the antihypertensives angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs thiazolidinediones tzds a class of oral antidiabetic drugs and ibuprofen risk factors which may increase susceptibility to the covid19 virus infection and which are common in generally elderly multimorbid cancer patients9   preproofthe clinical spectrum of sarscov2 ranges from mild upper respiratory tract infection with fever sore throat headache cough and potentially nausea and diarrhea the majority of cases recover without serious complications to severe pneumonia with sequelae that include acute respiratory distress syndrome ards cytokine storm and death10 because sars is an acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome digestive manifestations including inappetence nausea abdominal pain and diarrhea of covid19 resulting from binding of the virus to the ace2 receptor in the gi tract may precede respiratory symptoms11 gastrointestinal manifestations are potentially underappreciated and overlooked as sentinel symptoms that herald the onset or persistence of disease especially in cancer patients and may contribute to delayed or missed opportunities for testing diagnosis and containment unlike sarscov1 which seems to have disappeareddied out12 and mers which reappears only sporadically sarscov2 is less lethal with a fatality rate between  although this number is highly uncertain and debated13 but much more infective consequently public panic and economic disruption have ensued resulting in wartimelike mobilization efforts to mitigate its spread old age smoking and comorbidities such as diabetes morbid obesity immunosuppression frailty and cardiovascular disease appear to predispose to worse outcomes possibly secondary to impaired t and b cell responses  notably covid19 infection is associated with lymphopenia and delayed development of the adaptive immune response which appears to correlate with prolonged virus clearance and more severe disease progression15  the first pillar of defense against infection is hand washing avoidance of face touching and minimization of close contact ie social distancing with selfquarantine and selfisolation16 in case of exposure or evidence of covid19 symptoms respectively the second prophylactic pillar is vaccination with specific viral antigens or mrnas which are not yet publicly available although the company moderna has reportedly started testing an mrna vaccine in healthy volunteers and multiple other vaccination strategiesplatforms appear to be in progressunder development17    0c  transmission and prevention according to the world health anization who21 sarscov2 is spread persontoperson mainly via aerosol inhalation from sneezing coughing or exhalation 22and via fomitetoface contact since depending on the surface material the virus may remain viable and infectious for hours to days  figure  fecaloral transmission has also been hypothesized because diarrhea was a common feature with sars and mers and diarrhea and other digestive issues have also been reported in patients with covid1925 26notably transmission of sarscov2 is not limited to symptomatic individuals ie those with fever cough sore throat myalgias or dyspnea but also to asymptomatic or subclinically infected carriers of the virus which is problematic from the perspective of disease control 27and highlights the importance of containment measures including isolation and quarantine the basic reproduction number r0 of sarscov2 is   which means that on average for every patient an additional  individuals are infected  because coronaviruses may persist on inanimate surfaces like metal glass or plastic for up to  days careful disinfection with  or greater ethanol for small surfaces or  sodium hypochlorite for larger surfaces is recommended   preproofdiagnosis and clinical features    preproofthe available evidence is limited but clinical courses and outcomes of covid19 are likely to be worse in patients with cancer especially given the clear association between severity of disease and older age and higher levels of comorbidity  the overall case fatality rate cfr for the general covid19infected population is around  but in cancer it rises to  overall and to  in italy19 this cfr in cancer patients compares to  for no comorbid conditions  for cardiovascular disease  for diabetes  for hypertension and  for chronic respiratory disease   the aim of this review is to summarize and condense the current understanding of the transmission clinical presentation diagnosis and differential diagnosis pathogenesis treatment and prevention of covid19 with a special focus on cancer  in the united states the test of choice for sarscov2 is a nasopharyngeal swab specimen or sputum if a productive cough is present on which a reversetranscriptase pcr rtpcr assay or an enzymelinked immunoassay eia directed particularly at the envelope e rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp spike protein s and nucleocapsid n genes is performed the fda has also approved an antibody test29 a positive test for sarscov2 in a symptomatic patient generally confirms the diagnosis of covid19 with the caveat that false positive and false negative tests have been documented if initial testing is negative but a high index of suspicion and pretest probability for covid19 remains on the basis of patient signs and symptoms then retesting is indicated in patients with high indexes of clinical suspicion and equivocal or negative test results the who recommends that lower respiratory tract specimens which contain the highest viral loads should be obtained since nasopharyngeal swabs may miss some infections30 according to cdc guidelines disease is excluded on the basis of two    0c   preproofconsecutive negative tests respiratory tests separated by ¥  hours however in the presence of suggestive symptoms rectal swabs may also be indicated since the ace2 enzyme to which the virus binds is abundantly present in rectal epithelia cells31 the differential diagnosis for sarscov2 in cancer is extremely broad and includes conditions such as foreign body aspiration toxicities from chemotherapy and radiation tumor progression postobstructive pneumonia malignant obstruction atelectasis pulmonary embolism pneumonitis pulmonary edemafluid overload immunotherapyrelated pneumonitis copd exacerbation q fever adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus 229e hcov 229e coronavirus hku1 hcov hku1 coronavirus nl63 hcov

ab rsv ab rhinovirusenterovirus hrvev bordetella pertussis legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae32 the diagnosis of sarscov2 is complicated by the possibility of simultaneous coinfection with other respiratory viruses33 which is especially true for immunosuppressed cancer patients whose susceptibility to microanisms is increased the heightened infectious risk for cancer patients underscores the importance of screening them at presentation with extended viral respiratory panel testing given that coinfection may impact management decisions since conceptually at least the morbidity of covid19 and the risk of severe illness should increase in the presence of a second or third virus    preproofunlike infection with influenza for example covid19 signs and symptoms may vary considerably depending on the dose of viral inoculum route of inoculation concomitant medications and underlying health status34 to include fever  dry cough  fatigue  sputum production  shortness of breath  sore throat  headache  myalgia or arthralgia  chills  nausea or vomiting  nasal congestion  diarrhea  hemoptysis  and conjunctival congestion  with an incubation period of  to  days after exposure36 presymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection may majorly drive transmission especially since detected viral loads are similar in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients3738 populations of concern include the elderly smokers vapers and dual users those of any age with preexisting chronic medical conditions those receiving particular medications or therapies which upregulate the ace2 receptor or suppress the immune system and those from lower socioeconomic classes a conglomeration of factors which are often present in cancer patients as depicted in figure   while the surveillance focus for covid19 is on the respiratory tract enteric symptoms are a potentially underappreciated overlooked and misattributed manifestation of disease as stated earlier and this is especially the case for cancer patients where gastrointestinal toxicity occurs routinely from chemotherapy ie cisplatincarboplatinoxaliplatin irinotecan 5fluorouracil ifosfamide from targeted agents ie erlotinib imatinib bortezomib temsirolimus sunitinib regorafenibsorafenib and bevacizumab39 and from locally advanced or metastatic disease therefore abdominal complaints in cancer patients which are potentially but not automatically attributable to underlying disease justify further investigation especially if persistent worsening or new particularly because sarscov2 transmission may occur via the fecaloral route40    0c   preproofabnormal laboratory findings in covid19 include lymphopenia  percent prolonged prothrombin time  percent elevated lactate dehydrogenase  percent elevated ast and alt  percent elevated highly sensitive hs crp and elevated procalcitonin however because these parameters routinely fall well outside of the normal reference range in cancer patients it is difficult to confirm or refute the presence of disease on this basis alone chest radiographs and chest ct abnormalities are similarly nonspecific since the most common features multifocal groundglass opacities and consolidation mimic other pneumonias41 significant antibody production is observed after infection but it is unknown whether this helps or harms since antibodydependent enhancement ade may potentiate viral entry and the induction of a severe inflammatory response42   universal screening of cancer patients for covid19 is desirable but logistically impossible for the foreseeable future since diagnostic tests are in short supply and simply not always readily available43 hence covid19 rule out criteria are proposed in table  as a potential decisionmaking aide mÃ©moire which separates patients into low and highrisk groups by analogy to the wells criteria for pulmonary embolism4445  preventive measures focus on selfisolation social distancing with a 6foot 2m separation46 frequent hand washing with soap and water andor use of hand sanitizers patient isolation during clinical care use of masks to help prevent aerosol transmission and flushing with the lid closed to control socalled toilet plume in an asco guidance immunocompromised cancer patients are advised to minimize exposure to sick contacts and large crowds48 for healthcare personnel the use of personal protective equipment such as n95 masks ffp3 masks gowns eye protection gloves and gowns is mandated49   preproof vaccination and immunity vaccination efforts and the related topic of whether those who have recovered from covid19 develop protective immunity have drawn great attention the latter has implications on whether people who test positive for sarscov2 antibodies can be safely assumed to be immune and at negligible risk of contracting or transmitting the disease there have been case reports of patients who have recovered from covid19 and had recurrence of rtpcr positivity approximately one month after initial diagnosis with only one patient exhibiting significant clinical symptoms and another having a mild intermittent cough50 but while not zero the risk of transmissibility or recurrence of symptomatic disease in recovered patients has yet to be quantified and the paucity of currently available reports of recurrence in the setting of a pandemic suggests that it is low a separate practical question will be whether antibodybased tests prove to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify people who had asymptomatic infections developed immunity and can return to normal activities without jeopardizing disease containment efforts immunity may be due to antibodies cell mediated immunity or a combination of the two previous experience with using plasma from convalescent patients to treat severe cases of the first sars and mers as well as limited experience with covid19 suggests that antibody mediated immunity alone is clinically beneficial even during acute infection51 safety concerns about antibodies have been raised based on preclinical studies of sarscov vaccination in    0c   preproofferrets showing hepatotoxicity52 and of vaccination against feline infectious peritonitis virus another coronavirus leading to more severe disease when kittens were subsequently challenged with the virus53 although animal models may not be representative of human hostpathogen interactions the nature of sarscov and sarscov2 antibodies are likely different as crossneutralization was not observed invitro54 and experience with convalescent plasma has not borne evidence of antibody mediated enhancement of infection in acutely infected patients the potential risk deserves attention if vaccination is proposed for the entire population t cell responses are also readily observable in patients who recover from coronavirus infections55 and memory t cell responses alone were protective in mice56 with the potential advantage of longer persistence of memory t cell responses compared to humoral immunity when clinical data on vaccine candidates becomes available cancer patients may face different considerations surrounding vaccination than the general population particularly patients with hematologic malignancies being treated with agents targeting b cells who would derive greater benefit from vaccines eliciting cell mediated than antibody responses    preproofpathogenesis and pathology relating to ace2 and ras signaling  the ace2 enzyme  a key regulator of the reninangiotensin system ras57 to which the virus binds through its surface spike proteins is particularly abundant in the digestive tract lungs kidney heart and blood vessels where pathology from sarscov2 occurs58 a peptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin ii angii referred to as the quintessential perpetrator of inflammation to angiotensin  ang  ace2 mediates antiproliferative and vasodilatory functions that oppose the vasoconstrictive and inflammatory functions of angiotensin converting enzyme ace60  the binding of sarscov2 to ace2 leads to downregulation of ace2 expression potentially through increased internalization and shedding from the cell surface with decreased ang1 generation and increased ang ii levels as a consequence61 this unfavorably shifts the balance of the renin angiotensin system ras from the vasoprotective ace2ang17 axis to the aceang iiangiotensin  at1 receptor axis and drives a proinflammatory profibrotic and  proliferative response62 as shown in figure   fang et al63 contend that because thiazolidinediones ibuprofen and angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii typei receptor blockers arbs substantially increase the expression of ace2 they facilitate sarscov2 infection and therefore the risk of severe and fatal covid19 in contrast alghatrif et al64 present a diametrically opposed hypothesis that downregulated ace2 signaling is responsible for sarscov2induced acute lung injury ali acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and cytokine storm and that aceis and arbs are beneficial precisely because they increase ace2 expression and activity furthermore according to alghatrif et al lower ace2 levels and hence higher baseline oxidative stress and inflammation6566 are present in older comorbid individuals such as cancer patients which renders them more susceptible to severe covid19 than younger noncomorbid individuals with increased ace2 levels and lower baseline inflammation as shown in figure  furthermore low ace2 may promote tumor progression and conversely ace2 overexpression is associated with antiangiogenesis and tumor regression67 in summary then    0c   preproofdespite the concerns and controversy68 surrounding the use and continuation of aceisarbs during the sarscov2 epidemic it is likely that the pros outweigh the cons especially in cancer patients due to their potential antitumor and anticovid19 effects69 in line with ras involvement emerging data suggest that sarscov2 infection may induce serious cardiovascular injury or exacerbate existing cardiovascular disease cardiovascular sequela includes heart failure arrythmias disseminated intravascular dissemination dic and troponin elevation which may closely correlate with disease severity and the likelihood of inhospital death70 liu et al71 propose a mechanism whereby the virus which lowers hemoglobin hb levels72 binds to the porphyrin of heme and displaces iron thereby compromising the oxygencarrying capacity of red blood cells and exacerbating the hypoxemia since chloroquine and the experimental anticancer agent rrx001 also bind to porphyrins they may competitively interfere with binding by the virus  rationale for continuation or discontinuation of cancer therapy   preproofthe benefitrisk calculus that informs the decision whether and how to treat with anticancer therapy falls into a gray zone about which no consensus exists leading to a therapeutic dilemma on the one hand zhang et al73 in annals of oncology reported a strong association in  patients  of them  with lung cancer between antineoplastic therapy in the past  days and severe effects of covid19 hr4079  ci  p0037 on this basis the authors recommend treatment interruption dose reduction or substitution of cytotoxic chemotherapy with nonimmunosuppressive options eg checkpoint inhibitors if available especially in the case of lung cancer patients that are already prone to develop respiratory infections and complications74 similarly heavily immunosuppressed patients such as those who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are also particularly susceptible to viral respiratory infections these findings are supported by a nationwide analysis of data75 in china from  covid19 patients  of which were diagnosed with cancer this  patient cohort experienced a higher incidence of severe events  vs  p   and the administration of chemotherapy or surgery was found to have increased the risk of death andor intensive care unit admission even after adjusting for age sex and comorbidities odds ratio or   ci  p    while these studies are limited by small sample sizes the data suggests that cancer predisposes to more severe disease therefore since inperson contact increases the risk of transmission several institutions have mandated realtime video or telephone interactions alternatively referred to as telehealth77 postponed surgeries biopsies endoscopies scans and routine investigations when possible and in line with esmo guidelines78 encouraged conversion from the intravenous to the oral route eg 5fluorouracil to capecitabine etoposide and vinorelbine  on the other hand the immediate existential threat of progressive disease for which death is an impending imminent certainty rather than a remote possibility in the absence of treatment likely outweighs the theoretical risk of sarscov2 infection even in lower risk disease for example in situ or localized prostate breast and head and neck cancer delayed treatment is    0c   preproofpotentially conducive to tumor development and progression and thus may unfavorably impact prognosis79 hanna et al have proposed a triage strategy80 which prioritizes treatment for those patients with  imminent risk of early mortality from acute leukemias aggressive lymphomas metastatic germ cell tumors  oncologic emergencies such as spinal cord compression  chemoradiotherapeuticresponsive cancers such as head and neck cervical and anal cancers and  neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapyresponsive tumor types such as stage iii colon cancer and deprioritizes visits for surveillance and survivorship however in the absence of a one size fits all consensus recommendation which is unlikely since cancer is so genetically diverse and heterogeneous the decisionmaking process and the subsequent treatment plan are individualized and to be determined tbd on casebycase basis taking into account multiple factors including the risk of cancer recurrence if therapy is delayed modified or interrupted the type of therapy eg surgery radiation chemotherapy checkpoint inhibitors and stem cell transplantation extent of comorbidities concomitant medications patient preferences physicianpatient relationship race age the number of cycles of therapy completed and treatment tolerance  in terms of specific cancerrelated conditions asco makes the following heavily qualified recommendations81 \uf0b7  growth factor prophylaxis for neutropenia and neutropenic fever even at lower levels of risk  as well as empiric antibiotics for acute care \uf0b7  erythropoietinstimulating agents for anemia prophylaxis and transfusion when necessary depending on the patient context and underlying comorbidities   preproof treatment based on the high transmissibility of the virus82 the main nonpharmacologic countermeasures to mitigate or delay the impact of covid19 include rigorous hand hygiene use of facemasks respiratory etiquette ie coughing or sneeze into the upper sleeve or elbow not the hands flushing with the lid down to prevent bioaerosolization as well as quarantine stay at home policies and workplace and school closures which have upended the social cultural political and economic status quo  no specific treatment or vaccine is currently available although promising activity has been reported for hydroxychloroquine chloroquine arbidol remdesivir convalescent sera and favipiravir the mainstay of medical therapy includes symptomatic care such as supplemental oxygen antibiotics and hemodynamic and mechanical ventilatory support if indicated for septic shockmultiple an failure and respiratory failure respectively83 over  active clinical treatment trials are underway84 these include vaccines as well as a number of different agents some with promising preliminary data as mentioned above and also those with potential anticancer activity which will hopefully serve a double purpose first to treat covid19 and second as an adjunct to bridge the time gap until the patient is recovered and the primary antineoplastic is startedrestarted as shown in table     0c  preproof  conclusions the alarming spread of the covid19 pandemic has disproportionately affected cancer patients an atrisk population both from the standpoint of increased disease severity and disruption to care which includes widespread suspension of clinical trials in the united states that are already fraught with barriers to enrollment and participation85 86because the symptoms of covid19 are nonspecific underlying symptoms from the cancer eg dyspnea cough fever fatigue diarrhea etc which overlap with those from the viral infection may obscure and delay the diagnosis hence if the covid19specific rapid reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpcr test is not readily available andor in short supply which is currently the case diagnosis will depend on the maintenance of a high index of clinical suspicion especially in advanced cancer patients who check all the boxes for risk factors such as older age frailty disability immunosuppression generalized systemic inflammation and multiple comorbidities eg hypertension diabetes and cardiorenovascular diseases that predispose to severe disease and death    preproofthese comorbidities are commonly treated with renin angiotensin system blockers such as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors aceis or angiotensinreceptor blockers arbs which increase levels of ace2 the continued use of aceisarbs is the centerpiece of an intense debate because on the one hand sarscov2 coopts ace2 for target cell entry but on the other ace2 overexpression may counterbalance vasoconstriction and profibrotic processes and thereby reduce the incidence or mortality associated with covid19associated ali or acute respiratory distress syndrome  another controversy involves whether or not to continue cancer treatment given the high transmissibility potential of the virus however since no expert consensus recommendations have been issued to date and prognosis stage and responses to therapy are highly heterogeneous the riskbenefit tradeoff and subsequent treatment plan are highly individualized and context dependent  currently the focus of treatment is infection control appropriate symptomatic care and oxygen therapy no approved medication or vaccine has been developed but promising activity has been reported for hydroxychloroquine chloroquine arbidol remdesivir convalescent sera and favipiravir and several repurposed agents with antitumor properties are under investigation including thalidomide and rrx001 which may hopefully bridge the gap from the time covid is first diagnosed until the primary anticancer therapy is restarted  finally multiple comparisons have been made between the allout mobilization efforts to combat covid19 with the massive scaleup of human and material resources that occurred during world war ii8788 in the words of winston churchill prime minister of great britain from  whose intrepid fighting spirit iron will and intransigent defiance of tyranny galvanized the resolve of an entire nation to fight on in the face of seemingly impossible odds oncologists on the frontlines that have answered

7520,Colon_Cancer,"""what  clinicians  know  about  the  diagnosis  treatment and prevention of disease originates from studies mostly done  on  male  cells  male  mice  and  men1  historically for  multiple  reasons  including  the  purported  safety  of women and their offspring women of childbearing age were  excluded  from  clinical  trials  as  a  result  medical research and care have been centred on male physiology the  assumption  was  that  male  and  female  cells  and animals  were  biologically  identical  and  evidencebased medicine  was  defined  by  clinical  trials  done  predominantly  in  men1  in    the  us  national  institutes  of health nih mandated the inclusion of women in nihfunded  clinical  trials  but  many  investigators  did  not follow this mandate and many of those who did include women did not analyse the results by sex23 minimising the effectiveness of this policy preclinical research and drug development studies have also predominantly used male animal models and cells4 it is not surprising that a    us  government  accountability  office  report found that eight of the ten prescription drugs withdrawn from the market between  and  posed greater health  risks  for  women  than  for  men  most  funding agencies  from  europe  and  north  america  have  implemented policies to support and mandate researchers to consider sex and gender at all levels of medical research8 still the field of sexbased biology and medicine is often viewed  as  a  specialised  area  of  interest  rather  than  a central  consideration  in  medical

as a genetic modifier of biology and diseasesex differences in disease prevalence manifestation and response to treatment are rooted in the genetic differences between men and women genetic sex differences start at conception  when  the  ovum  fuses  with  a  sperm  cell carrying an x or a y chromosome resulting in an embryo carrying  either  xx  or  xy  chromosomes  this  fundamental difference in chromosome complement eg genes outside  the  testisdetermining  sry  gene  generates ubiquitous sex differences in the molecular makeup of all male and female cells9 first the y chromosome carries genes that exhibit subtle functional differences from their xlinked homologues eg zfy vs zfx and uty vs utx and also carries genes with no homologue at all eg sry in  addition  in  men  the  x  chromosome  carries  only maternal imprints ie epigenetic modifications made by the  parent  in  generating  the  sex  cellswhich  alter  the expression  of  genes  in  the  offspring  as  women  have x chromosomes from both parents they carry maternal and  paternal  imprints  which  target  a  different  set  of genes random inactivation of one of the x chromosomes in  female  cells  which  prevents  sex  differences  in x  chromosome  gene  dosage  causes  another  degree  of sex  difference  in  gene  expression  as  some  of  these xlinked genes escape inactivation in

fundamental  sex  differences  deriving  directly  from  genetic  heterogeneity between  the  x  and  y  chromosome  complements  and parentoforigin inher itance exist at the molecular level in all human cells these sex differences persist throughout life and are independent of sex hormones figure arguably  the  greatest  source  of  differences  between men and women comes from the y chromosomal sry gene which directs the development of a testis in men the  ensuing  developmental  surge  of  testicular  testosterone permanently masculinises the reproductive tract and  the  anisation  of  brain  circuits  affecting  male behaviour at puberty1112 in humans the first surge occurs at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy because it alters  cellular  gene  expression  and  tissue  structure  in multiple ans of men via epigenetic mechanisms this testosterone  surge  is  also  paramount  in  programming sex  differences  in  physiology  and  susceptibility  to diseases that will manifest in adulthood after this initial testicular testosterone surge gonadal hormone concentrations remain low until puberty which triggers lasting sex differences in circulating

developmental events programmes sex differences in physiology and susceptibility to diseases that will manifest in adulthoodoestrogen  receptors  will  be  affected  differ ently  in  men and  women  the  combination  of  all  genetic  and hormonal  causes  of  sex  differences  aforementioned culminates  in  two  different  biological  systems  in  men and  women  that  translate  into  differences  in  disease predisposition manifestation and response to treatment therefore  sex  is  an  important  modifier  of  physiology and disease via genetic epigenetic and hormonal regulations figure gender as a determinant of patients and doctors behaviour and as a modifier of health disease and medicinegender according to the global health  definition refers to the socially constructed norms that impose and determine roles relationships and positional power for all people  across  their  lifetime13  gender  interacts  with  sex the  biological  and  physical  characteristics  that  define women men and those with intersex identities13 gender is not a binary term it includes the understanding that in many  people  traits  of  masculinity  or  femininity  coexist and are expressed to different degrees gender attributes are fluid more than two thirds of women and men report genderrelated characteristics traditionally attributed to the opposite  sex1415  in  transgender  people  gender  identity differs  with  the  sex  they  were  assigned  at  birth  so  far transgender people have generally been underrepresented in clinical studies to date although this underrepresentation is changing gender is an equally important variable as  biological  sex  in  human  health  and  influences  the behaviour  of  communities  clinicians  and  patients1415 gender roles represent the behavioural norms applied to men and women in society which influence individuals everyday actions expectations and experiences including diet perceived stress smoking and physical activity and affect  health  and  disease  susceptibility  gender  identity describes the fluidity of how a person perceives oneself as a woman or a man which affects feelings and behaviours gender  relations  refer  to  how  we  interact  with  or  are treated  by  people  on  the  basis  of  our  ascribed  gender institutionalised gender reflects the distribution of power between men and women in the political educational and social institutions in society and shapes social norms that define perpetuate and often justify different expectations and  opportunities  for  women  and  men1617  as  such the  distribution  of  genderrelated  charac teristics  within populations  of  men  and  women  can  influence  health differently  than  biological  sex  together  these  gender constructs  determine  access  to  health  care  helpseeking behaviours and individual use of the healthcare system being perceived as a man or a woman triggers different responses  from  clinicians  who  might  diagnose  and suggest interventions differently according to gender as such  gender  largely  determines  the  use  of  preventive measures  and  referral  for  or  acceptance  of  invasive therapeutic  strategies  genderrelated  behaviours  contribute to risk exposure and preventive behaviour in several  wwwthelancetcom   vol    august  review 0cdiseases  this  postulation  is  well  exemplified  in  the cardiovascular field in which women often underestimate their risk compared with men and seek consultation later than  men  in  the  clinic  for  treatment  of  myocardial infarction1819  in  the  genesispraxy  prospective  study mortality    year  after  an  acute  coronary  event  was more strongly associated with gender than with biological sex1415  similarly  control  of  cardio vascular  risk  factors hypertension diabetes depres sive symptoms was better predicted  by  gender  than  by  biological  sex1415 therefore including  a  gender  dimension  in  clinical  studies  and practice will contribute to the understanding of different clinical  manifestations  and  outcomes  of  diseases  in women  and  men1617  although  beyond  the  scope  of  this review  it  is  also  important  to  consider  that  regarding health and disease gender intersect with race or ethnicity and  age20  sex  and  gender  are  fundamentally  and  frequently reciprocally interrelated in biology and disease24 sex influences behaviours eg towards more aggressive or caring  phenotypes  on  the  other  hand  genderrelated behaviours  eg  smoking  lifestyle

lowincome  and  middleincome countries where the burden of these diseases becomes increasingly  like  those  in  highincome  countries26  in most diseases efforts to separate the effects of sex and gender are still incomplete so that we just refer to the differences  among  women  and  men  because  current knowledge  about  pathophysiology  diagnosis  and  treatment of disease is primarily

for  integrating  the  concept  of  gender  and  sex  which shape divergent or distinct disease outcomes compared with men women suffering from ischaemic heart disease are older this difference is historically believed to be due to  the  protection  of  endogenous  oestrogens29  although contemporary  study  refutes  this  simplistic  explanation30 and associations cannot be inferred to be causation still women  suffering  from  ischaemic  heart  disease  are underdiagnosed3132  and  less  likely  to  have  a  prehospital diagnosis  of  myocardial  infarction33  the  reasons  for this

fibrosis  than  mens hearts4243  this  difference  is  partially  driven  by  sex hormones  as  oestrogens  produce  antiinflammatory actions  on  endothelial  and  immune  cells  and  promote cardioprotective  effects  in  premenopausal  women44  this response to treatmentcompared  with  men  women  suffering  from  ischaemic heart  disease  are  less  likely  to  receive  evidencebased treatment3132 and  when  suffering  from  acute  myocardial infarction they are less likely to receive reperfusion33 an stelevation  myocardial  infarction  registry  revealed  that compared with men women exhibit delayed reperfusion leading to higher mortality46 women suffering from acute myocardial  infarction  treated  by  male  emergency  physicians  have  a  higher  mortality  rate  than  those  treated by  female  physicians38  additionally  male  physicians  are more  effective  at  treating  female  patients  with  acute myocardial  infarction  when  they  work  with  female colleagues  and  when  they  have  experience  in  treating female patients38 this treatment disparity between women and  men  can  be  corrected  by  improving  emergency recognition  of  stelevation  myocardial  infarction  in women  and  acceleration  of  percutaneous  coronary  intervention which equilibrates gender mortality47guidelines for the treatment of heart failure are similar for  women  and  men24  however  evidence  suggests  that optimal  survival  in  women  occurs  with  lower  doses  of Î² blockers angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors than in men48 finally fewer women undergo heart transplantation than men although women are more frequently donors suggesting a referral bias could exist41cancersepidemiology pathogenesis manifestations and diagnosiscancers are the second leading cause of death dominated by  lung  cancer  accounting  for  ·  of  deaths  in men  and  ·  of  deaths  in  women  figure    more men develop cancer than

oesophagus and bladder the male versus female incidence ratios can be higher than  a male predominance in cancers that affect both sexes is evident around the world in all races and at all ages50 survival is also shorter  for  men  than  women  across  multiple  cancer types the higher cancer risk in men is partially explained by gender constructs like dietary habits or risk behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consump tion51 it is unlikely to  be  the  only  cause  after  appropriate  adjustment  for these  risk  factors  adult  men  still  have  a  higher  cancer risk  than  women52  moreover  a  similar  male  bias  in incidence  and  survival  is  seen  in  paediatric  cancers before  puberty  and  the  adoption  of  highrisk  cancerpromoting behaviours eg smoking53the universal male predominance in cancer incidence and differential outcomes argues for a fundamental role  wwwthelancetcom   vol    august  review 0cin inutero tumour  suppressors of  sex  in  addition  to

testosterone  in  male  cells56  these  mechanisms  have  an influence on several of the hallmarks of cancer57 including metabolism growth regulation58 angiogenesis and immunity  which  all  contribute  to  cancer  predisposition59  a crucial example is the male predisposition to glioblastoma which  is  the  most  common  form  of  brain  cancer  in glioblastoma  there  is  a  cellintrinsic  predisposition  of male  astrocytes  a  subtype  of  glial  cell  to  malignant transformation60  after  puberty  sex  hormones  produce additional epigenetic and acute effects on cells that further influence  sex  disparities  in  cancer  for  example  the increased frequency  and  aggressive  phenotype  of hepatocellular  carcinoma  in  male  individuals  has  been linked  to  the  stimulatory  effects  of  androgens  in  male individuals  and  the  protective  effects  of  oestrogens  in female individuals61 importantly the biology of cancer is not  the  same  across  histological  and  genetic  diagnostic groups or even within single histol ogical subtypes thus the  interaction  between  sex  gender  and  cancer  mechanisms  cannot  be  expected  to  be  constant  take  colon cancer the second leading cause of cancerrelated death for  example  although  women  have  a  lower  overall incidence of colon cancer than men they have a higher incidence  of  rightsided  colon  cancers  which  have  the worst outcomes62 tumours from women with rightsided colon  cancers  exhibit  a  distinct  molecular  signature  of energy metabolism compared with those of women with leftsided colon cancers63 this molecular signature is not observed when comparing tumours from men with rightsided colon cancers to men with leftsided colon cancers thus overall the male predisposition to cancer is probably the  consequence  of  genetic  program ming  of  male  cells and the effect of sex hormones after puberty interacting with genderspecific behaviours to establish cancer risksresponse to treatmentin  the  future  cancer  prevention  and  treatment  will  be improved by sexspecific and genderspecific approaches for example immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve survival  for  men  with  advanced  melanomas  and  nonsmallcell  lung  cancers  more  than  for  women64  the molecular  subtyping  of  glioblastomas  based  on  sexspecific  transcriptomes  has  the  potential  to  enhance chemotherapy in a sexspecific manner65 in colon cancer sex  differences  in  xenobiotic  metabolism  regulatory networks  might  underlie  greater  treatment  response  in women than men and require modification of approaches for  men  with  colon  cancer66  other  elements  of  cancer metabolism are also ripe for novel sexspecific targeting in  treatment  cellular  nutrient  partitioning  is  sexually dimorphic  so  approaches  such  as  ketogenic  diets  or glutaminase  inhibition  might  be  associated  with  substantial sexspecific responses67 furthermore data from models  of  development  ageing  and  cancer  all  indicate that molecular pathways such as the enzyme phosphatidylinositol  3kinase  and  tumour  suppressors  such  as p53 and retinoblastoma protein are sexually dimorphic and require sexspecific targeting545968chronic pulmonary diseaseepidemiology pathogenesis manifestations and diagnosischronic pulmonary disease is the third leading cause of death for women · of deaths and the fourth for men · figure  it is mostly accounted for by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to a lesser extent by asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterised by irreversible airflow limitation and is associated with  previous  exposure  to  smoking  or  air  pollutants women  are  overrepresented  among  individuals  with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease especially among those  with  earlyonset  disease  or  those  who  have  never smoked69 women are also twice as likely to have chronic obstructive  pulmonary  disease  with  chronic  bronchitis and  women  with  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary disease  have  as  much  emphysema  as  men  countering the  misconception  of  emphysema  as  a  male  form  of chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease70  the  female lung  is  more  susceptible  to  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary disease than the male lung and women develop symptoms  of  the  disease  at  a  younger  age  with  less tobacco exposure than men71 the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copdgene study72  suggests  that  earlyonset  chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease might originate in utero in susceptible women from alterations in lung development potentiated by  maternal  asthma  and  smoking  genetic  factors  or hormonal influences future studies should focus on the contribution  of  maternally  inherited  factors  such  as mitochondrial and x chromosome genes to understand disease pathogenesis it is important to consider gender constructs  as  well  smoking  advertising  campaigns targeting  women  rose  in  the  1960s  and  the  resulting higher  smoking  rates  influenced  womens  risk  for developing  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease73 from a disease severity vantage point chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation rates are also higher in women  than  men  especially  at  a  younger  age74  additionally  despite  the  burden  of  symptomatology  and increased  rates  of  hospitalisations  and  deaths  women with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  are  often misdiagnosed  and  disproportionally  suffer  from  comorbid  conditions including  anxiety  and  depression therefore physicians should consider chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the differential diagnosis of women with  pulmonary  symptoms  regardless  of  tobacco  or pollutant exposure historieswwwthelancetcom   vol    august   review 0casthma characterised by variable airflow obstruction and chronic airway inflammation also affects men and women differently asthma is more prevalent in prepubertal  boys  than  girls  regarding  asthma  both  male biological  sex  lung  development  and  atopy and  male gender  constructs  related  to  outdoor  play  and  indoor pet exposure are factors contributing to the devel opment of  asthma  and  sex  versus  gender  contributions  could be  difficult  to  separate75  from  puberty  onwards  more female  than  male individuals  have  asthma  with an  increased  severity  in  middleaged  women  and a  higher  mortality  rate76  this  phe nomenon  could be  secondary  to  gender  differences  eg  symptoms perception  or  healthseeking  behaviours  however biological  sex  plays  a  crucial  role  in  asthma  and  sex hormones  have  a  major  impact  on  female  asthma symptoms  and  severity  after  puberty75  worsening  of asthma  occurs  in  women  before  menstruation  and  is known  as  premenstrual  asthma  premenstrual  asthma is more common in women with severe rather than mild asthma obesity rather than normal weight and a long rather than a short duration of asthma77 premenstrual asthma is hypoth esised to be due to a fall in progesterone and  patients  with  a  severe  disease  respond  to  progestogens78  during  pregnancy  approximately  a  third  of asthmatic women exhibit a worsening of asthma a third show  an  improvement  and  the  remainder  are  unaffected79response to treatmentthe menopausal transition represents a pivotal time of accelerated  decline  in  lung  function  in  women  with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and thus represents a sexspecific window for treatment intensification these observations also suggest that oestrogens protect from  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  women exhibit  greater  expression  of  m2  over  m3  muscarinic receptors  and  accordingly  show  greater  improvements in lung function than men in response to the muscarinic anticholinergic  bronchodilator  ipatroprium80  pooled analyses of drug studies also suggest that women experience a greater improvement in quality of life than men after

7522,Colon_Cancer,"""  the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sarscov2 has caused the greatest worldwide pandemic since the  flu the consequences of the coronavirus disease  covid19 are devastating and represent the current major public health issue across the globe at the onset sarscov2 primarily attacks the respiratory system as it represents the main point of entry in the host but it also can affect multiple ans although most of the patients do not present symptoms or are mildly symptomatic some people infected with sarscov2 that experience more severe multian dysfunction the severity of covid19 is typically combined with a set of comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes obesity andor advanced age that seriously exacerbates the consequences of the infection also sarscov2 can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting diarrhea or abdominal pain during the early phases of the disease intestinal dysfunction induces changes in intestinal microbes and an increase in inflammatory cytokines thus diagnosing gastrointestinal symptoms that precede respiratory problems during covid19 may be necessary for improved early detection and treatment uncovering the composition of the microbiota and its metabolic products in the context of covid19 can help determine novel biomarkers of the disease and help identify new therapeutic targets elucidating changes to the microbiome as reliable biomarkers in the context of covid19 represent an overlooked piece of the disease puzzle and requires further investigation                      0c   introduction  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sarscov2 also called 2019ncov arose in the province of wuhan china in december  sarscov2 causes severe respiratory disease coronavirus disease  covid19   on march   the world health anization determined that the outbreak of a novel coronavirus had reached spreading pandemic as of august   there are over  million confirmed cases worldwide with more than  associated global deaths according to johns hopkins university   over the last  months the global population has been facing problems that impact both world health and global socioeconomics   covid19 has been and continues to be the focus of concern in a society threatened by the most destructive pandemic since the  flu transmission symptoms vaccines and treatments for covid19 continue to be investigated hiding too many unknowns the immediate strategy to curb the spread of this virus has been to recommend that people carry out a social vaccination which involves restricting social gatherings minimizing public appearances telecommuting implementing social distancing or wear masks as much as possible this is based on the high transmission ability of the sarscov2 via large respiratory droplets   and by airborne routes    unlike other viruses in the coronavirus family sarscov2 infects people who then have little or no symptoms   despite all this asymptomatic covid19 positive individuals can spread the virus   this silent transmission capacity is the main reason this virus continues to transmit and infect the global population in an accelerated and uncontrollable way in spite of best efforts to control and curb spread asymptomatic people manage to eliminate the virus without developing typical covid19 symptoms and this suggests to us that the immune system is relevant and may have the key to beat this virus covid19 affects not only the respiratory and cardiovascular systems but also to the central nervous system cns and gastrointestinal system   the objective of this review  is to examine whether the sarscov2 infection linked to gastrointestinal changes may be linked to                    0c  specific phases of covid19 associated to inflammation we will explore the studies on microbiome profiling intestinal immune system in the patients with covid19 this review will provide insights for microbiota modification therapy in the early stages of covid19 beyond antiviral and antiinflammatory approaches new therapeutic interventions might be possible through the restoration of the gut microbiome of individuals infected by sarscov2 to mitigate systemic inflammation intestinal damage and limit the effects caused in the cns through the braingut axis  early and late stage of the infection of sarscov2 a multitude of epidemiological studies describe different phases in the development of covid19 the early or viral phase shortly after infection marked by a high viral load and a reduced inflammatory activity with hardly any symptoms and which is also associated with gastrointestinal illness figure  besides patients with covid19 who had the highest viral load levels at the beginning of the infection and subsequently decreased over time could explain the rapid spread of the disease [ ] during the progressive or late phase of infection covid19 positive individuals develop most severe symptoms like respiratory problems and fever immune cells like neutrophils infiltrating monocytes and macrophages produce inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species also respiratory manifestations such as cough sputum production and shortness of breath remain the most common symptoms following fever or pneumonia [ ] in a study with  covid19 patients serum level of cytokines as interleukin il6 and il10 were indicators of disease severity showing that high levels of proinflammatory cytokine storm were associated with more severe disease development   some patients with covid19 had severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards cardiovascular conditions multiple an dysfunction syndromes or septic shock these complications are related to the release of cytokines and hyperinflammation or cytokine storm syndrome   figure  a person is more infectious in                    0c  the initial phase when the symptomatology of the disease does not manifest itself with respiratory symptoms and however the presymptomatic transmission may play an important role   nevertheless detecting sarscov2 infection in those without fever andor respiratory symptoms is difficult because sarscov2 tests are not usually performed in infected people without these symptoms  in summary a subset of the symptoms associated with covid19 during the initial phase are intestinal complications such as vomiting or diarrhea detecting these symptoms might not only lead to slowdown in transmission but also open the door to novel treatments that could reduce the severity of covid19 more studies are necessary to interpret the phases of the disease correctly and especially if the viral load detected is considered infectious and how it is related to respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms   clinical characteristics of covid19 patients with digestive symptoms and intestinal inflammation covid19 is an emerging infection that causes great concern about respiratory manifestations furthermore diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with covid19   however the significance remains undetermined a viral infection causes an alteration of intestinal permeability resulting in enterocyte dysfunction   when we investigate what happened with another coronavirus we found that diarrhea was a frequent symptom in sars patients occurring in    intestinal problems were also associated with the severity of the infection patients with diarrhea had an increased need for respiratory assistance and intensive care sarscov was also identified in ileal and terminal colonic biopsies   regarding mers several studies showed the presence of diarrhea between  to  of known cases   however a less severe prognosis of the disease was observed in mers patients with diarrhea                     0c  the first results linking intestinal problems with covid19 were obtained from patients in wuhan china two hundred four patients with covid19 presented at three hospitals indicate that the majority of covid19 patients had typical respiratory symptoms however many patients infected with the coronavirus complained of digestive symptoms such as diarrhea   there is no evidence on the efficacy of antidiarrheal drugs but adequate rehydration and potassium monitoring should be performed as in all covid19 patients diarrhea should generate awareness of a possible sarscov2 infection and should be investigated to reach an early diagnosis of covid19 this factor should be considered when suspecting whether the patients are infected instead of waiting for respiratory symptoms to appear which would give us an earlier diagnosis unless the coronavirus tests are also performed on asymptomatic individuals patients with covid19 specifically those with digestive symptoms remained a long time from onset to hospital admission and a worse clinical outcome compared to patients who do not suffer from these symptoms   likewise patients with digestive symptoms had an average time of  days from the onset of symptoms until admission while patients with respiratory symptoms had an admission time of  days   this may indicate that those with digestive symptoms waited longer to be diagnosed in the hospital as they did not suspect they were sarscov2 positive in the absence of respiratory symptoms authors also state that patients with digestive symptoms presented other associated clinical manifestations such as anorexia diarrhea vomiting or abdominal pain as the severity of the disease increased gi symptoms became more pronounced but especially the high percentage  of patients admitted with symptoms of anorexia   one study indicated that covid19 patients experience gastrointestinal gi symptoms such as diarrhea  anorexia  and nausea    however the underlying pathophysiology gastrointestinal is not well understood another study analyzed  hospitalized patients and some of them showed mild initial gi symptoms such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal pain which preceded the characteristic fever and respiratory problems such as dry cough in another study diarrhea                    0c  was reported in  patients and the fecal test remained positive until  days after the disease onset in  patients  the stool test was still positive despite negative respiratory tests   another study with  patients with low severity of covid19 including  presenting with digestive symptoms alone shows that patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance and fecal viruspositive than those with respiratory symptoms   a systematic metaanalysis of shows results from clinical studies with an incidence rate of diarrhea from as low as  and up to  of the cases   how is this disparity in the data possible more clinical studies are required to elucidate the percentage of covid19 patients that develop intestinal symptoms and if these depend on other factors such as age gender or other comorbidities  gastrointestinal symptoms are accompanied by inflammation or intestinal damage there is a loss of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbes that can activate innate and adaptive immune cells to release proinflammatory cytokines into the circulatory system leading to systemic inflammation some intestinal signaling pathways can regulate inflammation through dendritic cells figure  immunomodulation of the innate host immunity through the activation of epithelial receptors could represent a novel therapeutic target to eliminate sarscov2 in the early stage of the infection   the viral load of coronavirus appeared in the feces of  of the infected patients   an interaction between viral shedding of sarscov2 in stool has been reported but its association with infection was yet to be determined identifying fecal coronavirus rna may also lead researchers to ask new questions is there transmission of the coronavirus found in fecal samples what these researchers found is the presence of the coronavirus in the stool but there is controversial studies about if viral load was infectious nor examples of transmission previously a study involving  patients with covid19 reported that the median duration of viral shedding was  days in survivors range â days cultivable sarscov2 was detected in stool or urine specimens for longer than  weeks in three convalescent patients  days suggesting that it may remain viable                      0c  contradictorily high sarscov2 titres detectable in the first week of illness with an early peak observed at symptom onset to day  of disease [ ] although sarscov2 rna shedding in respiratory and stool can be prolonged the duration of a viable virus is relatively shortlived   the presence of sarscov2 including live virus with infectious capacity in the feces of asymptomatic individuals implies that covid19 could be transmitted through the fecal route   sarscov2 shedding in stool samples is detectable over a longer period than in nasopharyngeal swabs donors for fecal microbiota transplant for sarscov2 must be strict and validated to prevent the potential risk of transmission   the results show that the elevated levels of fecal calprotectin in patients with covid19 add to the growing evidence that sarscov2 infection causes an inflammatory response in the intestine   calprotectin concentrations were significantly higher in covid19 patients who had suffered from diarrhea and with more elevated serum il6 levels in the diagnosis and especially in the followup of covid19related diarrhea the calprotectin measurement could play a potential role in monitoring the disease also diarrhea may be secondary to virusinduced inflammation which in turn is due to the entry of inflammatory cells into the intestinal mucosa including neutrophils and lymphocytes and thus disruption of the gut microbiota viral sarscov2 ps were detected in feces during the second phase of covid19 accompanied by a decrease in the peak of inflammation therefore covid19related inflammatory diarrhea was associated with reduced levels of fecal sarscov2 rna   however intestinal damage can manifest after respiratory symptoms as reported in a clinical case there may be a pathogenic role of sarscov2 on the gi   in zheijiang china it was detected that half of the covid19 patients tested positive for rtpcr in their feces and intestinal microbial dysbiosis was also identified viral strains alive from feces were isolated indicating potential infectiousness of feces [ ] another analysis conducted from  studies in china usa and singapore had also detected                    0c  sarscov2 rna in fecal specimens of patients at an average of  this percentage is according to their clinical forecast intestinal problems or with more severe disease   furthermore the fecal test for sarscov2 rna also bears a potential implication for physicians to decide the subsequent isolation strategies for those with positive fecal samples the possibility of the fecaloral route of transmission of sarscov2 should be investigated all candidates for fecal microbiota transplantation and healthy donors should be screened for the virus   one could consider studies on the gut microbiome and its therapeutic role in transplanting feces in healthy donors to critically ill covid19 patients still precautions should be taken because infectious sarscov2 ps are known to have been found in covid19 positive feces the use of fecal transplants could be one of the immediate solutions in critically ill patients with a weakened immune system  sarscov2 interaction with intestinal ace2 receptors sarscov2 enters cells primarily through binding of protein s to angiotensinconverting enzyme ii ace2 receptors to infected cells   the central role of ace2 in the cleavage of angiotensin i to angiotensin ii a peptide involved in vascular homeostasis vasomotor tone and blood pressure regulation   ace2 receptors are expressed in various human cells susceptible to viral infection including epithelial cells in the lungs small intestine and colon tubular cells of the kidney neuronal and glial cells in the brain enterocytes vascular endothelial cells smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes   a very recent study has reported on the expression pattern of ace2 across more than  different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues and ans based on rigorous immunohistochemical analysis   sarscov2 also uses the receptors for transmembrane protease serine  tmrpss2 an enzyme that is expressed in the small intestinal epithelial cells   to entry to the infected cells figure  the sarscov2 activity could cause ace2 modifications in the gut that increase susceptibility to                    0c  intestinal inflammation and diarrhea a high coexpression of ace2 and tmprss2 was detected in enterocytes and the esophagus and lungs   the coexpression of ace2 and tmprss2 transcripts was highest in the small intestine with  expressed in enterocytes and  in colon cells as demonstrated by a singlecell rna sequencing study in gi   ace2 is not only playing an essential role in intestinal inflammation but also have a significant impact on the composition of the intestinal microbiota   ace2 ko mice have been shown to have decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides and exhibited altered intestinal microbial composition which is restored by the administration of tryptophan   likewise it is known that there is a connection of transport of ace2 amino acid with microbial ecology in the gut during sarscov2 infection   in another recent study using gnotobiotic germfree rats was observed a decrease in ace2 expression in the colon that contributed to the pathology during covid19   there are numerous studies that have shown that by regulating the reninangiotensin system ras which includes ace2 one can modulate systemic inflammation   angiotensin ii receptor blockers are widely used compounds that are therapeutically effective in cardiovascular disorders renal disease metabolic syndrome and diabetes   under normal healthy conditions homeostasis of rasace2 occurs   while a perturbation to this system is observed in cardiovascular disease hypertension and diabetes mellitus   a reduction of ace2 is associated with hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular problems which represent the significant comorbidities of covid19   sarscov2 may potentially further upregulate ras in cardiovascular patients and deplete ace2 downregulation of ace2 levels in tissues has been linked to viral replication efficiency and pathogenicity   leading to the imbalance of positive and negative regulation of ras rasace2 imbalance in covid19 may greatly exacerbate tissue inflammation and may contribute to more adverse covid19 outcomes in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities ace2 receptors may represent a target for covid19 treatments   in patients  with cardiovascular risk burden susceptible to conditions that worsen asymmetries in rasace2 however suppression of                    0c  ace2protective roles due to ace2 depletion upon sarscov2 infection is very likely to uphold the poor outcomes observed in covid19 patients especially in those with preexisting conditions ace2 also displays nonrasrelated roles linked with neutral amino acids transport and gut homeostasis ace2 has been implicated in the intestinal epithelium regulation of gut microbiota composition and function   in summary ace2 imbalance is likely a key player for the poor outcomes in the covid19 patients with preexisting comorbidities and addresses a possible link for gut microbiota dysbiosis in this interplay  the effects of covid19 on the gut microbiome primary inflammatory stimuli trigger the release of microbial products and cytokines which can cause microbial dysbiosis that can induce an inflammatory environment releasing intestinal cytokines into the circulatory system increasing the systemic inflammation of covid19 taken together a combined inflammation can potentially initiate an immune reaction that can create even more harm than the virus itself it is necessary to know the host cytokine pathways and microbiota interactions with cytokine responses in sarscov2 infection to develop novel treatment approaches it is essential to investigate how intestinal bacteria interact in response to sarscov2 infection  among covid19 patients an increase of a blood proteomic risk score prs was associated with a risk of becoming a clinically severe infection a recent study has shown more than  proteins in bloodrelated to the severity of covid19   these proteins included immune factors that are elevated during systemic inflammation such as creactive protein crp correlations between prs and the intestinal microbiome might be associated with the severity of covid19 this new analysis would allow us to predict if the patient would develop more severe symptoms in the next days or weeks after the infection ruminococcus gnavus was identified in covid19 patients and positively correlated with inflammatory markers while                    0c  clostridia was negatively correlated   another small study of  patients hospitalized in hong kong has served to establish a gut microbiome profile in association with covid19 severity and changes in fecal shedding of sarscov2   through the application of indepth shotgun metagenomics analysis the authors investigated longitudinal changes of the gut microbiome in covid19 the abundance of coprobacillus clostridium ramosum and clostridium hathewayi correlated with covid19 severity and it was observed an inverse correlation between the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii an antiinflammatory bacterium during the hospitalization time were detected in covid19 patients bacteroides dorei bacteroides thetaiotaomicron bacteroides massiliensis and bacteroides ovatus which downregulate the expression of ace2 in the murine gut correlating inversely with sarscov2 load in fecal samples   this study opens the doors to possible interventions for gut microbiota in hospitalized patients to reduce the severity of covid19 another study of just  patients showed that the gut bacteria was associated with fecal sarscov2 load the gut microbiome remained substantially different in hospitalized patients from that of healthy controls a total of  bacterial species were identified to be significantly associated with the fecal viral load of sarscov2 across all fecal samples   this does not indicate that the gut microbiome is affected for long periods after recovery and future therapeutic interventions would be necessary  sarscov2 was detected in feces of  hospitalized patients with covid19 and the viral transcriptional activity was analyzed to determine the infectivity range associated with the gut microbiome fecal samples with a signature of high sarscov2 infectivity had higher abundances of bacterial species collinsella aerofaciens collinsella tanakaei streptococcus infantis and manella manii in contrast fecal samples with a signature of lowto no sarscov2 infectivity had higher abundances of scfas producing bacteria parabacteroides merdae bacteroides stercoris alistipes onderdonkii and lachnospiraceae bacterium   however live sarscov2 was not isolated from the feces covid19 patients another study                    0c  of  covid19 patients showed a significantly reduced bacterial diversity and a higher relative abundance   they compared these results with  h1n1 patients who showed lower bacteria diversity compared with covid19 patients specific microbial signatures were identified in covid19 patients which could help identify biomarkers that differentiate them from influenza a h1n1 patients when there is a coinfection   despite this the phases of the disease were not established in this study furthermore in another study with  covid19 patients was observed a reduced alpha diversity in microbes   the metatranscriptional analysis revealed that there were  differentially genes associated with immune pathways and cytokine signaling related to the diagnosis and severity of covid19 such as interferongamma signaling   despite reporting interesting patterns the studies mentioned above are not without limitations the bioinformatics analyses employed in these studies does not guarantee specieslevel nor strainlevel bacterial identification furthermore no longitudinal analysis has been performed with the same patients to determine if these bacteria change after recovery from covid19 more studies that prospectively include infected but asymptomatic subjects positive for sarscov2 but with different degrees of symptoms would be necessary to establish a correlation with microbial markers or their products monitoring early in the disease during early onset of covid19 and over the longterm will help to delineate the role of changes in the microbiome will be critically important to elucidating this connection further another major limitation is the small number of patients and the absence of information about microbial changes in the context of covid19 that define broad groups of the population stratified by geography ethnicity gender andor age to date there are no metabolomics and metaproteomic analysis studies that are needed to explore the products of these bacteria and their function by identifying microbial metabolites associated with covid19 we can understand what components these bacteria produce during covid19 that help us understand the influence of the communication pathways of the microbiotagutperiphery axis relevant to the association between sarscov2 and                    0c  hyperinflammation moreover more studies investigating the correlation between sarscov2 and gut inflammation are necessary including histopathology and molecular diagnostic assessments   comorbidities as risk factors for covid19 associated with loss of microbial diversity sarscov2 can infect people of all ages but older adults and people with preexisting medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming seriously ill with the virus   there are many hypotheses as to why this occurs still one of the factors could be the loss of microbial diversity associated with aging and with it higher susceptibility to inflammation comorbidities play an essential role in determining the risk of severe complications and death after covid19 infection covid19 comorbidities and risk factors include asthma hypertension smoking male gender or alzheimer's disease or dementia   changes in gut microbiota have been previously linked to all of these comorbidities and this deregulation could also be associated with changes in the immune system and the susceptibility to suffer more severe consequences of covid19 and genderrelated differences in vulnerability to complications of covid19 our microbiome changes as we age which favors less diversity and a more significant inflammatory state covid19 appears to be more dangerous in older people men and with comorbidities   the gut microbiota evolves during human life   the infant microbiota shows reduced diversity and will remain unstable for the first few years of experience until it becomes an adultlike microbiota    the gut microbiota within an individual is considered stable throughout adult life   in the elderly gut microbiota diversity decreases and dysbiosis increases and is associated with cognitive deficits depression and inflammatory markers   a change that is found repeatedly in the microbiota of the elderly is the decrease in the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes [ ] decreased bacterial diversity as well as lower levels in specific bacterial groups have also been observed in very elderly [  ] at the genus and species                    0c  level the findings vary significantly between studies although bacteroides clostridium and lactobacillus appear recurrently altered in elderly individuals tragically a high rate of covid19 fatalities is associated with groups of people over  years old   the causes may be the inability to overcome the infection the weakness of the immune system and the reduced microbiome diversity causing the coronavirus to strongly attack this group of the population causing a higher mortality rate another recent study has found significant associations between dietary patterns and measures of gut microbial composition in older men   the group of the population with the highest mortality rate from covid19 obesity is also associated with changes in the intestinal flora [ ] and is another risk factor in the severity of covid19   therefore another comorbidity in adults   and children   in the united states at least  of patients who die from covid19 have obesity which is similar to the reported rates of cardiovascular disease in the same highrisk group    it is necessary to study the relationship between obesity and the severity of the covid19 disease adipose tissue can serve as a reservoir for the spread of sarscov2 virus clearance and systemic immune activation   adipocytes in obese patients express higher levels of ace2   and a reduction or elimination of already inflamed adipose tissue can reduce systemic viral spread viral entry and prolongation   in obese individuals there is marked dysregulation of myeloid and lymphoid responses within adipose tissue associated with dysregulation of cytokine profiles obese patients also have heightened levels of proinflammatory adipokines leukotrienes chemerin among others which may exacerbate their risk for cytokine storm syndrome and death    the alteration of the immune system causes changes in the intestinal flora and it remains to be seen whether the coronavirus also induces changes in the bacteria that modulate many of these functions of the intestinal brainmicrobiota axis the bacterial intestinal flora plays a critical role in the regulation of neurological functions such as depression or anxiety [ ] surely the results of these studies allow us to know                    0c  what the role of intestinal flora is in covid19 and its relationship with neurological problems at long term   furthermore diabetes is another disease associated with increased severity of symptoms and complications of covid19 and this can be attributed to systemic inflammation and gutmetabolite dysfunction   individuals suffering from cardiovascular disease who become infected with sarscov2 are at increased risk of developing a worse prognosis of covid19 and also develop cardiovascular complications including myocardial infarction arrhythmias stroke or heart feature or myocardial suppression   cardiovascular disease is accompanied by an imbalance of gut microbiota and a decreased microbiome diversity   hypertension is likely to be influenced by diet lifestyle factors and microbiome   notably an increase in shortchain fatty acids scfa was previously associated with decreased blood pressure and improved arterial compliance    changes in the gut microbiota composition through diet to deal with covid19 the impact of dietary patterns on susceptibility to and severity of infection with the sarscov2 virus has been largely ignored to date the commensal microbiome forms a dynamic environment that can be altered and cause dysbiosis from virus infection but can be positively modulated by diet components and probiotic treatments   several studies show than an optimal immune response depends on proper diet and nutrition to control sarscov2 infection [ ] in general malnutrition can compromise the immune response therefore affecting the vulnerability of the response to covid19 consideration of the dietary and nutritional components the factors during viral infection can serve to strengthen the immune system for the prevention of infections and a meaningful and balanced basis for an immune response is an adequate and balanced diet intake of a sufficient amount of protein is crucial for the production of antibodies also a low level of vitamin a or zinc has been associated with an increased risk of infection branchedchain amino acids can maintain the hairy morphology of                    0c  the intestines and increase intestinal immunoglobulin levels thereby improving the intestinal barrier   therefore highquality proteins are an essential component of an antiinflammatory diet nutritional dietary components known to exert antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties include omega3 fatty acids with high antiinflammatory and antioxidant capacity including vitamin c vitamin e and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols that are widely present in plantbased foods   undoubtedly omega3 fatty acids appear to have the most potent antiinflammatory capability several of these components can interact with cellular signaling components related to antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects an "

                     in and for healthcarein waiting rooms for future appointments procedures and treatmentsis performed overwhelmingly by people who are poor kennedy    oostrom    in this  we focus on what we are calling active waiting a concept that we suggest more accurately describes the lived experience of gaps in healthcare action than does the more frequently used word delay when contemporary health disparities researchers examine patient behavior and action as it relates to the timing of treatment they often focus on patients delaying diagnostic tests or treatments while understanding  why  a  person  might  delay  a  diagnostic  procedure  or treatment regimen can identify barriers eg long wait times on phones or for followup procedures a lack of transportation or money that discourage individuals from taking more immediate actions diamant    thinking in terms of delays can also place excessive responsibility and blame on individuals for nonaction and nonadherence hunleth    why did she delay scheduling her followup appointment is not the same as why did she wait to schedule her appointment  and  though  waiting  can  lead  to  assumptions  about passivity or nonaction social scientists have demonstrated that waiting is not a passive state auyero  mulcahy    we derive our own focus on active waiting as opposed to delay from narrative interviews we carried out with people who have chronic illnesses and who have difficulties affording their medications studies of chronic illness in the us offer important insights into waiting people living with illness and in poverty wait a lot during the many appointments needed to manage their conditions ie foron health service and treatment providers and for disability insurance and paychecks ie foron bureaucratic actors of key importance active waiting unlike delay remains true to the linguistic preferences of the individuals with whom we have worked participants in the study we describe below spoke of their experiences of temporality in healthcare as of waiting and not as of delaying further the concept of active waiting allows us and others working in and studying healthcare to move beyond analyses that either locate responsibility for wait times solely with the individuals ng the waiting or perpetuate overlydeterministic views of systemic barriers that erase experience and social action to frame our conceptualization of active waiting we bring together two scholarships one on the political economy of healthcare which includes the elucidation of bureaucratic time and the other on waiting as a feeling and an experience which gains meaning within power relations and through social interactions  bureaucratic time and the agency of waiting patients who then comply with bureaucratic state demands auyero  waiting may be imposed but these researchers show that it always entails a response understanding the experience of waiting in the us requires recognizing that the actions people take while waiting are interpreted using neoliberal ideologies that privilege among other things individual responsibility mulligan  rylkobauer and farmer  this focus on individual responsibility can lead to the blaming and shaming of people who time healthcare inappropriately or do not act appropriately within  others  expected  timeframes  holmes    scholars  have shown that this privileging of individual responsibility reinforces racialized and classed hierarchies of deservingness horton  notions of individual responsibility and thus of individual failure place pressure on patients to do and in ng they avoid or mitigate the likelihood of blame and shame while they wait as we have previously shown the focus on individual responsibility can lead people to blame themselves  and  their  loved  ones  for  waiting  too  long  to  seek  care hunleth    sociologist andreas g¨ottlich suggests that waiting is an interaction that depends on the mutual interpretations of the actorsthose who wait and who are waited uponas well as others who behold the scenes of waiting g¨ottlich  p  that is people wait in relationship to and  with  others  researchers  who  center  the  interpretive  acts  and emotions of waiters in healthcare settings such as waiting rooms offer several insights into what we refer to as active waiting in a study of interactions  in  a  waiting  room  strathman  and  hay  suggested  that when patients are told that they cannot get an appointment within the desiredeven physician recommendedtimeframe it is like being told that their health and by extension they as persons are less important than bureaucratic schedules strathmann and hay  p  that is waiting can add to a sense of being devalued or neglected andaya  sj¨oling    and it can negatively influence peoples perceptions of their quality of care and confidence in their care provider bleustein    given the above work we understand active waiting to be the experiences  and  responses  that  people  devise  to  navigate  shorten  or otherwise survive waiting and also to anticipate and craft possible futures within the relationality and power dynamics of bureaucratic time resisting wait times by seeking information and other resources is part of  active  waiting  as  is  delaying  and  complying  active  waiting  is composed of such discrete actions that people might take as patients in one place or time but is irreducible to those actions and must be situated in how people manage multiple wait times at various scales further we include not only action but also how waiting on bureaucratic time feels carr teucher and casson  have used the phrase lived wait time to communicate the fact that feelings of time differ by circumstances researchers have shown that chronic illness lends itself to particular feelings of time and of life including those of time as suspended eg feelings that life is on hold brown    mulcahy    sj¨oling    we expand this by focusing on how chronic illness feels while waiting on powerful others to make life or death decisions while wait time is lived people also live during their wait times daily lives are not easily paused sj¨oling    this means that the circumstances of individuals days and lives often change while they wait on healthcare less has been said about the waiting that goes on outside of clinical settings yet is ultimately tied to health in fact waiting is an implicit and normalized mechanism of bureaucratic systems in what follows we consider how these various aspects of time and waiting combine for people experiencing illness and financial strain we use active waitingconceptualized as an action orientation relationship and feeling that is irreducible to a singular time and place and which shapes how individuals approach their health in particular times and places we do so in order to best examine how various aspects of time and waiting interweave in the lives of people who are chronically ill and poor though healthcare bureaucracy in the us requires most people to wait for care how long people wait how waiting is structured and the consequences of waiting vary people who do not have access to insurance or other resources must endure state and federal evaluations of their lowincome statuses abilities to work severities of illness citizenship and more to qualify for assistance tickamyer    as funding for social programs like medicaid food stamps and disability are rolled back and work requirements become stricter demonstrating qualifications  to  obtain  support  is  increasingly  difficult  and  time consuming whittle    while social welfare programs offer access to health services they often require long waits in waiting or exam rooms at facilities that accept medicaid or offer services on a sliding fee scale becker  oostrom    researchers have identified how people deal with the bureaucratic schedules that shape the course of their treatment mulcahy    described how some people with cancer resisted the assumptions that they must be patient patients by seeking information and resources to shorten their waiting periods still other researchers have shown that long waittimes for healthcare personnel in clinics and waiting rooms can lead to other forms of action waiting can push individuals out of the healthcare system or lead them to delay care becker  and it can induce  feelings  of  pervasive  uncertainty  and  powerlessness  among socialsciencemedicine26420201132962 0cthis research comes from a mixed methods study investigating cost related  issues  that  affect  adherence  to  medications  recruitment occurred in  and  amidst political uncertainty about changes to healthcare legislation on the national stage a new and controversial presidential administration was beginning its term this administration had goals to repeal the affordable care act aca and introduce block grant funding to medicaid which remained a possibility throughout our data collection period for people with chronic illnesses the aca was significant it mandated that preexisting conditions be covered by insurance plans and that insurers offer at least a minimum prescription drug benefit while also creating platforms for uninsured individuals to purchase plans additionally national conversations about changes to prescription drug pricing were prominent in news coverage most of our narrative interviews were conducted in st louis missouri though a few occurred in east st louis illinois missouri did not expand their medicaid program with the rollout of the aca illinois did st louis is a metropolitan area with significant racial and economic health inequities to address the health needs of those without insurance in light of not expanding medicaid the gateway to better health program was created which provided basic coverage to people living below the poverty line this program was set to end in december  during our study but its extension was later approved beyond that date many of the people who participated in this study were using or had used this program  recruitment  interviews our research team recruited people between the ages of  and  who had one or more chronic illnesses for which they were prescribed medication  and  who  identified  as  having  difficulties  affording  their prescriptions the study had a mixed methods design participants in the survey n   were recruited from newspaper ads federally qualified health centers and a multispecialty clinic a subsample of the survey participants n   also participated in a narrative interview focused on financial strain while we have presented the mixed methods results elsewhere this  focuses solely on the narrative interviews we initially aimed to recruit  interview participants stratified evenly based on prescription insurance coverage age and gender however this was adjusted based on the availability of participants the final number of interviews was  table  the  interview  guide  was  based  on  the  mcgill  illness  narrative interview mini groleau    we revised the guide and refer to it as the modified financial and illness narrative interview it is structured similarly to the mini to elicit different types of narratives but with an added focus on financial history two local nonprofit community  anizations  were  selected  as  interview  locations  due  to  their proximity to and rapport with the participant population nonclinical environments available private interview spaces and anizational relationships with study team members trained research team members conducted interviews and a note taker was present in most cases the  interviewer  obtained  informed  consent  and  interviewees  were compensated with a  gift card interviews were audiorecorded and lasted  about    minutes  immediately  after  the  interview  the interviewer and note taker wrote detailed field notes using a structured template that included their observations about body language any conversations  not  recorded  a  summary  of  the  financial  and  illness narrative and reflective memos  analysis interviews were professionally transcribed verbatim deidentified and checked for accuracy before being uploaded with their respective fieldnotes to nvivo  we describe the codebook development below which was designed with the mixed methods study in mind during that codebook development the team identified the repetition of comments about waiting across the interviews the  team  developed  a  codebook  using  deductive  and  inductive codes deductive codes were based on questions of interest from the quantitative survey these focused primarily on medication cost coping access to basic needs and related concepts the team identified inductive codes while conducting interviews and refined and added to these codes while reviewing transcripts during the analysis and throughout the coding process we took note of a crosscutting theme in the narratives when asked to describe what it was like to deal with chronic illness  participants  said  that  chronic  illness  was  about  waiting  we coded  all  discussions  of  waiting  in  the  interviews  defined  as  any mention of waits or delays and in the fieldnotes while waiting is a broad concept and was used to reference different processes we chose to include in our analysis all aspects of waiting described by participants rather than focus on just one eg waiting for health insurance coverage we did so to acknowledge that people may experience waiting that is interrelated and different from the temporal distinctions made by many healthcare practitioners four team members coded  the  interviews  using  the  final  codebook  all  transcripts  were coded by at least two team members and discrepancies were reconciled through consensus between the two coders al memoed on the waiting code throughout this process focusing on issues such as what kinds of things people waited for how this influenced their decisions and emotions the outcomes of their waiting on their health and healthcare and how waiting shaped their aspirations for the future the team including coders  interviewers  and  investigators  compared  how  waiting  was discussed within and across the transcripts and narrative types elicited by

breadth of waiting that shapes how people wait and answers the question waiting for what the second section addresses the question waiting for whom and describes how participants ascribed meaning to waiting according to their social and economic positions and in relation to those in power what some participants referred to as the waiting game finally and building on the previous sections we focus on waiting as an active process that people manage through a variety of tactics in ng so we detail the ways in which people actively wait living their lives within structures of power that make them wait socialsciencemedicine26420201132963 0caa lee

participants referred to when they talked about waiting the list  was  long  and  it  included  waiting  in  waiting  rooms  for  transportation on the phone for surgery for paychecks and welfare checks for housing and for approval for disability and insurance benefits the things participants waited for varied according to their own unique health and social circumstances these waits were often predictable and included the spaces in which people wait eg waiting rooms the bureaucracies that enforce waiting eg disability claims the conditions  that  create  waiting  eg  strained  social  safety  net  and  the financial demands that when unmet lengthen wait times eg a ride when one does not have transportation a paycheck to afford a prescription the variation in chronic illnesses and in life circumstances of participants  in  the  study  however  meant  that  they  discussed  the structures of waiting in different ways and put emphasis on different aspects within the predictability and variability there was an overarching theme of waiting for one or a succession of big things to happen what we term big waits  big waits were for things that had a hopedfor endpoint ones that might change an individuals health situation for example many participants talked about waiting for disability assistance to come through or for health insurance coverage to start or for stable  housing and  they often  centered  their discussions of  waiting around this primary event the endpoints could be a decision made by a social service agency or could be an anticipated and desired life change one woman told us that her big wait for insurance coverage was almost over because she would soon be eligible for medicare which multiple others also mentioned that they were awaiting the good news for me is a year from this august  i turn  but um i always feel like its all pending there is nothing concrete in any of the healthcare while participants talked about big waits in terms of their endpoints they also talked about how such endpoints led to other big waits take kate for example kate is a black woman in her early fifties who previously  worked  in  home  healthcare  she  has  osteoarthritis  graves disease hepatitis c and depression after both her mother and husband died a  few years ago she struggled to afford housing and continue working through her arthritis pain when we interviewed kate she had been  homeless  for  several  months  and  was  recently  accepted  off  a waiting list for transitional housing kate had several big waits that came in succession and were contingent upon one another she waited for housing assistance she waited for medical release to work after sustaining injuries in a car accident she waited to consult with a doctor about surgeries she waited on a disability hearing scheduled months away  though she  had  been  diagnosed  with hepatitis  c  her  doctor would not begin treatment until her disability application was approved because of the high costs of the medication which would be covered if she were on disability kate worried that all of these big waits would have longterm repercussions on her health until  the disability  [benefits are approved]  or  something [else comes through] and september [the date of her disability hearing] comes they aint going to even give me the medicine ¦ we will just wait and see so i am just in limbo until until my hearing ¦ i know i aint going to die right away but i do want to get the medication kate found herself waiting a lot on a lot the interdependence of her waiting meant that one wait exacerbated other waits while taking care of her sick family members she put off her own health needs and bill payments leading to her eventual housing instability her lack of a consistent mailing address delayed her ability to submit a disability application even after she found more stable housing and was able to see a doctor the disability application delays led to postponed medical treatments without getting her health and injuries under control she could not work and get out of transitional housing for kate each big wait  led  to  another  big  wait  with  worsening  and  compounding  repercussions on her health and wellbeing other participants described having waited years for their disability applications to be approved or often denied in the meantime they incurred greater debt hired lawyers relied on family for support postponed treatments and endured these big waits  waiting for disability benefits and for other significant changes in their financial or familial situations  also created a number of smallerscale daytoday situations in which study participants waited one uninsured woman described waiting to fill her prescription and waiting to see her doctors while she searched for a full time job to afford both you wait to the extreme before you do anything about whatever the problem is because you dont want to go to the hospital it costs  too  much  many  participants  missed  appointments  or  went without  medications  while  waiting  for  new  insurance  benefits  or payday or financial assistance paperwork to go through holding off on care was just one way to wait actively available to those whose actions were constrained by chronic illness and financial strain while big waits figured strongly into participants imaginations of their futures small waits were not insignificant allens diabetes had damaged his kidneys so severely prior to getting medicaid coverage that he needed dialysis he described the cycle of waiting while on dialysis allen  whose big wait had been first getting medicaid coverage and then once covered getting on a kidney transplant list  did not have a car or a steady way to get to his weekly dialysis appointments a few times a week he waited to be picked up by a medicaidcovered transportation company he had little control over when they would arrive and their arrival was often sporadic when they arrived early he had to wait at the clinic when they were late he either had to pay for his own cab or push back his dialysis appointment to later in the day and wait even more optimistic allen expressed gratitude that he was able to use medicaid and live with his brother while waiting for a kidney transplant his own big wait within multiple small waits while enduring the small waits he imagined a better future after the transplant describing to us what he would write in a book about his experiences kidney transplant got him back to a better life now hes back in the work force he hasnt looked back to the sickness yet ¦ thats my story the daytoday waiting was frustrating but the promise of this story along with having family able and willing to assist him an unmarried man without children shaped how he waited and his feelings while waiting big and small waits contribute to the dynamic aspect of active waiting where social ties and financial resources regulate how one is able to navigate and survive waiting waiting was drawn out for those without the economic resources to avoid institutions such as slidingscale clinics welfare agencies and financial assistance programs throughout the interviews participants described waiting as chronic but they also held onto a sense that once a waiting period passed then their future goals of health and financial stability would be that much closer for kate waiting was incremental and each waiting period required different tactics the big waits participants  described both  promised  and suspended  the  future people grappled with the present while anticipating what might happen when and if the waiting ended some people imagined a time when they could afford  healthcare  holding  off  certain  appointments  until  that  time while others imagined a future in the work force and attended appointments diligently even in the face of smaller or shorterterm waits such small waits too structured participants responses in how they waited based on what they were waiting for  waiting for whom the waiting game many participants identified feeling like the systems in place to assist chronically ill and financially strained people were playing games with their lives by making them wait they were made to wait by social service programs appointment schedules hospital and clinic waiting rooms insurance company call centers the waiting punctuated their socialsciencemedicine26420201132964 0caa lee

them guessing about the reasons behind their extensive chronic waiting they guessed at answering why mewhy they had to wait they also guessed at a course of action to shorten or otherwise deal with waiting the waiting game they described was one in which the odds were stacked against them the rules were opaque and endurance was necessary to win some study participants searched for ways to get around the game or to play it to their advantage how they played the waiting game  which we recognize as active waiting  depended on both their interpretations of the meaning of waiting and on the resources to which they had access in our interviews some people brought up suspicions about being forced to wait for appointments and in waiting rooms due to their economic status age race and other discriminatory factors one participant talked about how once in the examining room she felt as if her time waiting was not reciprocated by providers they do not want to spend a lot of time with you you know theytheyve got to make a living too so they move on some speculated that doctors reserved time for people of  a  higher  economic  status  these  patientprovider  dynamics  that waiting exemplified left people feeling slighted by the medical system ah i sat there in that waiting room for  hours and and they still wasnt ready to see me ¦ no one had the respect ah even the courtesy to come out and say well the doctor is running a little bit behind people felt that their lives were undervalued and unimportant when their time was not acknowledged  or  respected  that  bureaucratic  systems  seemed  to withhold resources by imposing waiting suggested to some a denial of their belonging and deservingness as patients and as humans worthy of care experiences of medical racism and sexism frequently underpinned participants feelings that their time was being wasted rachel a black woman told us that she had been working and paying taxes since she was a kid and still the welfare system did not support her when she needed it recognized that high blood pressure was  black peoples  number one killer and explained that her waiting also stressed her body contributing to her anger these indignities played out in the clinic adding to the  daily  stresses  she  said  she  already  felt  as  a  black  woman  and grandmother living near the ferguson neighborhood where an officer murdered michael brown in  and was not indicted for that murder participants  also  talked  about  waiting  as  a  game  that  required endurance not just because of a lengthy office wait or the months or years it could take to get a disability application approved or denied but because  of  the  opacity  of  the  process  they  questioned  application processes wondering if the wait to hear back about welfare and assistance services was a test of endurance it is just a waiting game [for disability] until they get tired tired of you being in front of them and they decide to give it to you that is what they hope for is [you] giving up on it but if you keep with it sooner or later you will get it while a number of participants expressed optimism for a better future once a big wait was over waiting out bureaucratic processes wore down that optimism i dont believe i can keep going through this too much longer erica said she was exhausted from the strain of balancing utility payments with medical costs while waiting for her new insurance plan to begin and while coping  with  illness  unexplained  waiting  on  bureaucratic  systems whether for an application to be approved or for insurance to kick in or to be seen by a busy doctor in a slidingscale clinic felt like an unfair game designed to keep them from receiving necessary medical care by framing waiting as a game the participants explained that there were rules that shaped the length and types of waiting and that they did not  write  them  the  rules  were  far  from  transparent  and  enforced differently based on race and social status as sherry made evident in her frustration with being made to wait waiting is not a passive state that happens  without  mental  and  physical  consequences  when  people responded with patience and endurance through the game just like when they responded with anger and confrontation their waiting was active put differently participants described fashioning tactics in part based on their perceptions of the intentions of those for whom they waited they kept turning me down for disability and they kept saying i was too young to have problems i had you know but my body was breaking down and the doctors would never [help with the application] which was really so unfair and now thats the part that really makes me feel a little sad like there is so much  i hate to say racism  but just unfair treatment because im a woman because of my age and then because of my race and so were talking like years [voice breaking] ¦ it made me be really poor rachels doctors held the power to demonstrate that she qualified for disability  but  as  she  recounted  they  were  unwilling  to  fill  out  the documentation she needed to apply

7525,Colon_Cancer,"""ammatory bowel disease ibd is a long life disease with remission and relapse periods ibd arises as a result of inappropriateimmune response to intestinal commensal anisms in individualswith genetic predisposition and consequently causes ammation andintestinal ulcers   in addition ibd has a complex pathogenesis andmany factors such as dysbiosis oxidative stress and epigenetics thatmay also be involved in disease pathogenesis [] ulcerative colitisuc and crohn's diseases cd are known as two main forms of ibdaccordingly these diseases cause intestinal ulcers and some annoyingsymptoms such as diarrhea abdominal pain and rectal bleeding occasionally the severity of these symptoms is very high which can leadpatients to be hospitalized in this regard therapeutic approaches totreat these diseases mainly focus on prolonging remission and are almost similar however diï¬erential diagnosis can also help to treat thedisease in a more eï¬ective way for example 5asa which is acommon drug in the treatment of ibd is less eï¬ective on maintainingremission in cd patients on the other hand antibiotic therapy is notrecommended for the treatment uc but it can be eï¬ective on cd patients    diï¬erential diagnosis is a serious challenge because cdand uc have significant similarities in terms of their clinical endoscopic and histological features however there are some diï¬erencesbetween uc and cd which are summarized in table1 in addition tointestinal complications uc and cd also have significant extraintestinal manifestations for example it was shown that uc is significantly associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis and cd is alsoassociated with cholelithiasis especially in cases that the ileum is involved   furthermore cd can cause ï¬stulas to the urinary systemwhich leads intestinal bacteria to enter the urethra and recurrent urinary tract infections   both cd and uc can cause several disorderssuch as arthritis erythema nodosum pyoderma

rate ineurope and its prevalence in the newly industrialized countries of asiaafrica and south america also appears to be increased over the pastthree decades  unfortunately the peak of the disease is at the young age of years old   therefore in addition to the suï¬ering from icts on the patients it also has many negative eï¬ects on societymoreover many ï¬nancial burdens are annually imposed on countriesfor controlling and treating this chronic disease the invasive diagnosticand therapeutic measures are currently undertaken to diagnose andmanage ibd which are unpleasant for patients as well as having thehigh associated costs now the gold standard method for diagnosingibd and monitoring patient status is performing colonoscopy examination and histopathologic evaluation which are invasive measures  therefore in recent years many studies have been conducted toï¬nd a suitable laboratory marker with suï¬cient sensitivity and speciï¬city for the purpose of diagnosing and noninvasive management ofibd a high proportion of these studies have investigated the eï¬cacy offecal calprotectin in diagnosing and monitoring patients althoughsome of these studies reported auspicious results there are still somedoubts on the eï¬ectiveness of fecal calprotectin on diagnosing andmonitoring ibd patients so in this review we addressed the advantages and limitations of fecal calprotectin for the diagnosis andmanagement of ibd the role of fecal calprotectin in diagnosis and management ofibdthe eï¬cacy of fecal calprotectin as an laboratory marker in various areas of ibd diagnosis and management have been studied including ibd diï¬erentiation from irritable bowel syndrome ibs evaluation of endoscopic activity of the disease evaluation of histologicalactivity of the disease and prediction of disease recurrence andclinica chimica acta   response to treatment in following after a brief introduction andmentioning the important points regarding laboratory measurement offecal calprotectin we reviewed the most interesting ï¬ndings in all ofthe abovementioned areas calprotectin a clinically valuable proteincalprotectin is an antimicrobial protein mainly secreted by neutrophils this protein competes with bacteria over zinc thus kills thebacteria however this is not the only contribution that it has to antimicrobial activity moreover this protein has many potential clinicalapplications such as the elevated serum levels that have been observedunder various immunological and immunopathological conditionsserum calprotectin levels rapidly increase in response to bacterial infections in the kidney and heart or during transplant rejection at theearly stages of ammation of the lung serum calprotectin can also beconsidered as a reliable marker besides plasma levels of calprotectinappear to be useful in reï¬ecting disease activity in ammation of thejoints   in addition it has been demonstrated that serum calprotectin levels are increased in patients with bacterial sepsis so it can beconsidered as a reliable biomarker   in neonatal sepsis the serumlevel of calprotectin increases as well as a sensitivity of  and aspeciï¬city of  that have been reported for serum calprotectin indiagnosis of neonatal sepsis   it has been recently shown thatserum calprotectin levels increase in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and higher levels in the ï¬rst  of onset areassociated with a poor prognosis at the ï¬rst three months   serumcalprotectin levels also increase in patients with rheumatoid arthritisand even in patients with a moderate to high disease activity who havenormal or low crp levels so they appear to be more eï¬cient at reï¬ecting disease activity  some studies have also investigated the eï¬cacy of serum calprotectin in the diagnosis of cancers correspondingly in one of thesestudies it was shown that serum calprotectin levels significantly increased in patients with laryngeal carcinoma compared with healthyindividuals and those with benign laryngeal pathologies moreover inthis study a direct relationship was also observed between serum levelsof calprotectin and stage of cancer   another study showed that theserum level of calprotectin increased in patients with papillary thyroidcarcinoma but it significantly decreased after operation   alsoregarding the eï¬cacy of serum and saliva calprotectin for the diagnosisof ibd impressive results have been reported    a study onpatients with ibd both uc and cd have shown that serum calprotectinlevels were directly correlated with fecal calprotectin levels and weremore potent in ibd diagnosis compared to crp and albumin this studyalso indicated that the combination of serum calprotectin with crp oralbumin can be helpfulin the prediction of treatment escalationespecially in patients with cd   however no significant correlationwas observed between serum calprotectin and fecal calprotectin levelsin patients with cd and uc as well as a slight correlation betweenserum calprotectin level and crp that was observed only in patientswith uc   another study showed that the serum level of calprotectin was significantly higher in patients with cd compared to healthyindividuals in addition although a significant correlation was observedwith the clinical activity of the disease no significant correlation wasfound between the level serum calprotectin and endoscopic activity ofthe disease   the eï¬cacy of salivary calprotectin in the diagnosisof ibd has also been studied which showed that salivary calprotectinsignificantly increased in patients with ibd compared to healthy individuals in this study auc values for unstimulated saliva and stimulated saliva to distinguish ibd patients from healthy individualswere reported to be  and  respectively   however thepopularity of calprotectin is mainly due to the use of fecal calprotectinin the diagnosis and management of ibd that is discussed in the following 0cf khakikhatibi  clinica chimica acta    laboratory measurement and reference intervalfecal calprotectin is a stable protein that remains stable for  daysat room temperature   this property is an excellent advantage for alaboratory marker also it seems that keeping the specimen at refrigerated temperature  °c can increase the stability of fecal calprotectin   however evidence has been obtained regarding thatthe stability of this protein decreases after staying for three days atroom temperature on the other hand it is not also recommended tokeep samples in the refrigerator for more than  days   it seemsthat fecal calprotectin remains stable up to one year at  °c  measurement of fecal calprotectin can be done both qualitatively andquantitatively accordingly in the qualitative measurement monoclonal antibodies are used to detect fecal calprotectin and the positiveresults are characterized by the appearance of colored lines on the testcassette however in the qualitative one only positive or negative results are reported and despite  of sensitivity test speciï¬city in theevaluation of disease activity was reported to be only  it seems thatthe main application of this test is to diï¬erentiate healthy individualsfrom ibd patients rapidly however some studies have shown that it isnot accurate enough in this case as well    nevertheless asignificant concordance has been reported between home test resultsibdoc and fecal calprotectin laboratory measurement results whenquantum blue calprotectin elisa kit was used notably the agreements between results were  and  depending on the selectedcutoï¬s   several commercial kits are also available for fecal calprotectin qualitative test known as rapid calprotectin these tests reportpositive results ranged from   to  µgg there are also severalcommercial kits that can be used for the quantitative measurement offecal calprotectin these kits are usually designed in terms of the elisamethod and some have a measurement range between  and µgg moreover the chemiluminescence immunoassays cliamethod can also detect values between  and  µgg fluoro enzyme immunoassays feia and particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassays petia can also be used for the measurement of fecalcalprotectin in this regard one of the most serious challenges to thelaboratory evaluation of fecal calprotectin is the determination of theupper limit in healthy individuals among healthy adults there is asignificant agreement on  µgg as an upper limit one study suggested values up to  µgg in people over  years old and up to µgg in children aged between  and  years old as referenceranges of fecal calprotectin in healthy individuals  fecal calprotectin levels appear to be higher in healthy infants andchildren under four years old than in adults and further studies areneeded in this regard to determine the acceptable upper limit for diagnosis of pediatric ibd   table  lists the median levels of fecalcalprotectin in healthy individuals with diï¬erent ages reported in somestudies according to these reports age can aï¬ect fecal calprotectinlevels fecal calprotectin and ibd diagnosisonly a small percentage of patients complaining of abdominal painand diarrhea have ibd in many cases ibs as a functional gastrointestinal disorder is known as the cause of such clinical symptomspatients with ibs have normal colonoscopy results while ibd patientsindicate abnormal colonoscopy results and have intestinal ulcersunfortunately the significant prevalence of ibs and the overlap between clinical symptoms and ibd can increase the colonoscopy ratetherefore a noninvasive diagnostic marker can be very helpful in thisregard notably the ï¬rst evidence of the eï¬cacy of fecal calprotectin inthe diagnosis of ibd was obtained in the 1990s rÃ¸seth   in proposed a method for measuring calprotectin in stool specimens  one of the ï¬rst and most interesting studies regarding fecal calprotectinutility in ibd diagnosis was the study by rÃ¸seth   published in in this study  patients with ulcerative colitis were studied and according to their results fecal calprotectin levels are higher in patientswith ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls this study havealso shown that even patients with low disease activities had higherlevels of fecal calprotectin compared to healthy individuals  subsequent studies somehow conï¬rmed and complemented the ï¬ndings of this study in another study published in  auc values of  ci  were reported for fecal calprotectin in thediagnosis of colorectal ammation   moreover in a study onchildren with ibd it was shown that the level of fecal calprotectin washigher in these patients compared to healthy children so it can beconcluded that it is also directly correlated with esr levels

  in our recent study a sensitivityof  and a speciï¬city of  at a cutoï¬ of  Î¼gg were observed for fecal calprotectin in the diagnosis of ibd however oursample size was  and the majority of patients

ibd where the small intestine is involvedbesides there are some preanalytical limitations which are explainedin the next sections therefore optimistically speaking fecal calprotectin measurement can eliminate the need for colonoscopy howeverin a metaanalysis performed to evaluate the eï¬cacy of fecal calprotectin and some other ammatory markers to diï¬erentiate betweenibd and ibs the probability of ibd was less than  at fecal calprotectin values lower than  µgg or crp values lower than  mgdl  therefore it seems that fecal calprotectin can be helpful at leastin ruling out the possibility of ibd in patients with ibslike symptoms aswell as reducing the rate of colonoscopy moreover it should be notedthat although a systematic review has reported pooled sensitivity andspeciï¬city above  for fecal calprotectin to diï¬erentiate between ibdand ibs it emphasized more on the possibility of falsepositive resultsin low cutoï¬ points   hence performing extensive studies indiï¬erent countries on the healthy population and the ibd patient is beneeded to determine a suitable cutoï¬ with maximum sensitivity andspeciï¬city and minimum falsepositive resultstable  summarizes the results of various clinical investigationsregarding fecal calprotectin utility in the diï¬erential diagnosis of ibdfrom ibs and table4 summarizes some metaanalysis results in thisregard as shown in table  the most important limitation of the majority of clinical studies conducted to date is the small sample size alarge global study may be helpful in providing a more precise evaluation of fecal calprotectin clinical value in discrimination between ibdand nonibd diseases fecal calprotectin and endoscopic and histologic activity evaluationundoubtedly one of the most serious challenges in the managementof ibd is evaluating the endoscopic and histologic activities of thedisease nowadays colonoscopy and histopathologic examinations arethe routine tools for the assessment of mucosal healing in patients withibd as noted earlier several scoring systems have been devised toscore disease activity based on the ï¬ndings of colonoscopy and histopathologic examinations in recent years many promising results havebeen reported regarding the correlation between these scores and fecalcalprotectin levels in addition many studies have been performed inthe last decade all of which cannot be reviewed in this article the ï¬rstevidence of a link between fecal calprotectin and disease endoscopicactivity was obtained in the late 1990s in one of the ï¬rst studiesroseth   found a significant correlation between fecal calprotectinlevels and endoscopic and histologic activities in patients with ulcerative colitis   furthermore in another study they observed that ibdpatients who were in remission clinically and had normal fecal calprotectin levels less than  mgl had normal colonoscopy results  these interesting ï¬ndings indicate that fecal calprotectin can beconsidered as a

fecalcalprotectin and ibd endoscopic activity although some of these studies reported a strong correlation some others reported a relativelyweak correlation as noted earlier there are significant diï¬erencesbetween the reports on the sensitivity and speciï¬city of fecal calprotectin to predict the endoscopic activity of ibd undoubtedly a widerange of factors from sample size and the inclusionexclusion criteriato preanalysis variables and indexes used to evaluate the endoscopicactivity may also contribute to these diï¬erences however fecal calprotectin does not appear to be a very reliable marker for the predictionof ibd endoscopic activity so currently it seems a bit optimistic toconsider fecal calprotectin as a reliable alternative for colonoscopy inthis regard further studies are still needed however under some certain circumstances such as pregnancy or pandemics the use of fecalcalprotectin to evaluate ibd endoscopic activity can be helpfulpregnant patients with ibd have serious limitations for colonoscopyexamination and it has been recommended that colonoscopy should beonly performed in the second trimester of pregnancy and where there isa strong indication   therefore noninvasive markers such as fecalcalprotectin can be helpful during pregnancy in one study physicianglobal assessment [pga] which is a clinical symptombased criterionwas used to evaluate ibd activity and subsequently the associationbetween fecal calprotectin and this criterion was investigated in pregnant women with ibd the results of this study showed a significantcorrelation between fecal calprotectin and pga levels at prepregnancyduring pregnancy and postpartum stages   in another study asignificant association was reported between fecal calprotectin levelsand clinical activity

activity at diï¬erent stages ofpregnancy   a recently published systematic review has also conï¬rmed the conclusions obtained from these studies   according tothese results it seems that fecal calprotectin is not aï¬ected by physiological changes during pregnancy however it is significantly correlatedwith ibd clinical activity during pregnancy therefore from the viewpoint of relatively acceptable sensitivity and speciï¬city in predictingthe endoscopic activity of ibd fecal calprotectin may be considered as anoninvasive biomarker for the evaluation of ibd endoscopic activity inpregnant women in addition under pandemic conditions fecal calprotectin can be very helpful following the covid19 pandemicwhich began in late  and is still ongoing healthcare systems indiï¬erent countries were forced to impose significant limitations oncolonoscopy therefore noninvasive ibd management and fecal calprotectin as a noninvasive laboratory marker have become moreimportant than before the combination between disease clinical activity and fecal calprotectin has been recommended as a noninvasiveapproach that can help in making decisions on treatment duringcovid19 pandemic   therefore it seems that fecal calprotectincan be considered as an alternative for colonoscopy used for ibd endoscopic activity evaluation during pandemic fecal calprotectin appears to be associated with ibd histologic activity as well given thediï¬culty in the evaluation of the histologic activity of crohn's disease  some studies have been focused on the ulcerative colitis andmany scoring systems have been devised so far correspondingly thesesystems score the disease's histologic activity based on histologic observationstherefore for this purpose a biopsy of the intestinal tissue is required which can be prepared by colonoscopy and then sent to thelaboratory in this regard one of these histologic scoring systems isroberts score that was used in one of our recent studies where weobserved a significant correlation between the level of fecal calprotectinand the histologic activity of ulcerative colitis which was calculatedbased on the roberts scoring system   theede   also

pathology of influenza virus the most common respiratory virus infection influenza virus belonging to the orthomyxoviruses family is among viruses that cause respiratory tract infections rtis several

rhinovirus hrv  enterovirus     influenza  virus  ifv  respiratory  syncytial virus rsv and adenovirus are common etiological agents of acute respiratory disease   influenza a virus iav initiates pulmonary inflammation and intensifies chronic lung diseases in response to the infiltration of inflammatory cells and augmentation of airway hyperresponsiveness   the main target and host for iav is the bronchial epithelial cell which plays a key role in influenza pathogenesis   infection occurs following  h of influenza virus replication for the first cycle and then initial high titers of virus are shed during this period ifv infection can result in several symptoms like fever cough headache and pneumonia which may become immunologically incompetent   while the induction of inflammatory cytokines by influenza infection is attributed to its systemic feature it is unlikely that the virus to be propagated outside the respiratory tract during an uncomplicated infection   one of the key components of the influenza virus in pathogenesis is ha domain which is recognized by the hosts neutralizing antibodies the emerged ha is directed to the cell membrane in an infected host cell fastening to the cell membrane by means of a short transmembrane region at the cterminal and once this domain attached to terminal sialic acid residues on the cell it facilitates entry and fusion of the virus due to the acidification of host cells by proton pumps ha rearranges so that the highly conserved nterminal of ha2 is exposed this exposure leads to the fusion of viral membrane with cell membranes and thus activation of the replication complex   despite  all  known  clinical  and  pathogenesis  descriptions  of  the influenza virus the mechanism through which influenza virus disease being developed has not precisely understood however it is thought that local nonimmune cells which release early cytokines are the cause of many of the clinical signs   some cytokines including ifnÎ±

stimulated  by tnfÎ±  and  il1  and  both  cytokines  potently  upregulate  leukocyte adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium therefore mediating the first indispensable step for sequestration of neutrophils and or macrophages into the respiratory tract a study by van reeth demonstrated that there is a correlation between bal fluid levels of some cytokines ifnÎ± tnfÎ± and il1 and virus

role of probiotics on influenza virus in the context of preclinical studies mm2 can significantly reduce influenzaelicited proinflammatory cytokines such as il6 and tnfÎ± moreover a slightly elevated ifnÎ± level in the balf indicated the impact of this probiotic on the enhancement of nk cell activity these results along with the reduction of pulmonary mrna levels of nk cell activators including proinflammatory cytokine il1 and chemokines mip2 and mcp1 suggest the modulating effect of this probiotic on influenza infection   in  another  study  continuous  oral  administration  of  lactobacillus plantarum 06cc2 led to an elevation in the production of ifnÎ± and th1 cytokines il12 and ifnÎ and reduction in the production of tnfÎ± and il6 cytokines in balf this probiotic could also control the number of total infiltrated cells such as macrophages and neutrophils in the balf of infected mice   similarly nagai   revealed that  days after  oral  administration  of  the  yogurt

this  probiotic  can  modulate  some  disease  outcomes attributed to changes in cytokine profiles such as that happens in the lung after influenza infection   in our very recent study we showed that bifidobacterium bifidum can increase  the  level  of  both  th1  ifny  and  il12  and  th2  il4 since the manifestation of probiotics impacts on several diseases from nonviral to viral ones [] several studies have surveyed the probiotic roles in immune responses of influenzainfected animal models it has been fully demonstrated that upon infection with influenza  many  cytokines  such  as

protecting effects of the probiotic by downregulation of acots acot1 acot2 and acot5 cyr61 egr1 and fos as well as upregulation of stfa1 and antiviral rsad2 genes in the lungs of uninfected mice   in agreement with all aforementioned results harata   revealed that oral administration of probiotics lactobacillus gg and l gasseri tmc035 in mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza ah1n1 pdm prompted the secretion of il12 il6 ifnÎ and iga from isolated pp cells in vitro however unlike lactobacillus gg the oral administration of l gasseri had no impact on the production of ifnÎ il6 as well as total iga in vivo proving the vital role of probiotic interaction with the component cells of galt in the protection against influenza   the investigation of the effects of l casei strain shirota

administration of bifidobacterium longum bb536 could significantly reduce the loss of body weight inhibit viral proliferation in the lungs and improve the symptoms  of  influenzainfected  mice  which  may  be  related  to  the decreased level of il6   belkacem   observed that while administration  of  probiotic  l  paracasei  induced  significantly  higher levels  of  proinflammatory cytokines  in  probioticfed influenza mice models this trend was reversed seven days upon influenza challenge except for il33 the number of all tissueresident or circulatory myeloid cells  and  b  cells  after  the

besides the increase in nk cell activities and antiinfluenza virus iga the expression of cd25 by both cd8 and cd4 lymphocytes highly increased in the lungs of mice these results recommend that

out as fast as possible against such an outbreak of viruses interestingly accumulated data obtained from clinical investigations on  patients who suffered from severe covid19 in a hospital  in  wuhan  demonstrated  the  presence  of  signs  for  cytokine storm  especially  among  patients  in  severe  stages  of  the  disease particularly the levels of cytokines and chemokines involved in both th1 such as il1b ifnÎ and th2 il4 and il10 immune responses were promoted in studied patients moreover the levels of ip10 mcp  mip1a and tnfÎ± were in direct correlation with the severity of patients symptoms   on the other hand it has been determined that the cytokine storm may lead to a rise in platelets and longer hospitalization of covid19 patients   other studies also have revealed other aspects of virallydriven manipulation of immune responses by human coronaviruses [] therefore addressing the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of patients infected with sarscov2 while some reagents such as steroids can be considered as hyperinflammation suppressors their sideeffects impede to count on them as a trustworthy medicine for covid19   alternatively addressing the urgent

probiotics  as  a  safe  available treatment with the ability to modulate immune responses and manipulate cytokines production have been considered to be studied against different strains of

cells triggered by probiotics with respiratory viruses in the lung following virus infection immune cells in the airway such as dendritic cells and macrophages secrete cytokines to defend against viruses in a probioticreceived subject the high concentration of cytokines leads to the migration of immune cells to the lung space through the gutlung axis resulting in rapid recruitment of activated t and b cells in the lung that eventually promote upregulation of virusspecific immunoglobulins and cytokines in probioticreceived subject whereas in the absence of activated immune cells the respiratory virus can cause severe lung damage due to the lack of immediate immune responses responses in mice models   there have been other articles using different types of probiotics for displaying the desired genes or antigens against pedv [] for instance liu   demonstrated that their modified lactobacillus plantarum has the property to act like a strong antiviral agent against coronavirus infection in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line    probiotic impacts on other viral respiratory infections eguchi  et  al  demonstrated  that  lactobacillus  gasseri  sbt2055 lg2055 when administered orally to mice before infection with a human rsv could suppress the virus titre in lung tissue homogenates rsv  replication  and  the  intensity  of  the  symptoms  moreover  a decrease in the expression level of proinflammatory cytokines and an increase in the mrna level of ifn ifnÎ oas1a and isg15 in the mice lung upon probiotic administration are satisfactory evidence for antiviral properties of this probiotic also swi2snf2related creb binding protein activator protein srcap introduced as a candidate for the antiviral activity of lg2055 against rsv   to  investigate  whether  probiotics  can  control  the  inflammatory pathway and modulate the coagulation system upon respiratory viral infection rhamnosus crl1505 was orally administered in rsv or ifv mice models the results elucidated that this probiotic could successfully modulate tlr3triggered immune coagulation reaction in the lung upon viral infection and prevent exacerbated respiratory injuries notably this study substantiated the vital role of probioticprovoked secretion of il10  in  taming  the  coagulation  system  after  the  viral  attack    additionally in a study conducted by tomosada   nasal administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 and crl1506 has proved to modulate elevated respiratory levels of the proinflammatory mediators caused by administration of the viral pathogenassociated molecular pattern polyic moreover a nasal administration of the probiotic prior to   pfu of rsv challenge improved resistance against rsv infection   considering the effect of probiotics on the parainfluenza virus there is only one study evaluating the antiviral effects of oral administration of lactococcus lactis subsp lactis jcm5805 in a mouse model of murine parainfluenza  virus  mpiv1  infection  the  probiotic  administration resulted in a rise in the survival rate of treated mice without any weight loss and also a decline in the lung histopathology scores compared to the nontreated  group  which  was  attributed  to  the  incorporation  of jcm5805 into cd11c immune cells in pp and thereafter activation of pp pdcs and ultimately elevation of ifns expression it is of note that although no activated local pdcs were observed at lung upregulation in ifnsinduced antiviral factors in the lung may be due to the delivery of ifns from the intestine of jcm5805fed mice into the lung   studies reporting the effects of probiotic bacterias on respiratory viruses have been demonstrated in table supplementary section  clinical evidence of probiotic

attempts have done to incorporate probiotics to modulate immune responses consequently  leading  to  balanced  responses  and  optimal  outcomes  in combating viral infection   in this regard an investigation on the impact of bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis bl04 on healthy adults showed a modest modulation of innate immune host responses upon infection with hrv particularly reduction of

tnfÎ±  in  patients  with  severe inflammatory  diseases  by  affecting  various  metabolic  cycles     recently  several  studies have shown that propolis extract and some of its components act against several important targets in  the  pathophysiological  context  of  the  disease  caused  by  sarscov2  such  as  reducing tmprss2 expression and reducing ace2 anchorage which would otherwise facilitate entry of covid19 compared to individuals with mild disease   there  is  considerable  evidence  that  propolis  can  reduce  and  alleviate  the  symptoms  of the  virus  into  the  cell

however despite considerable evidence that  propolis  can  reduce  and  alleviate  disease  symptoms  its  acceptance  as  a  healthpromoting supplement in human medicine has been limited in many countries such as the usa because of a relevant  criticism that propolis products  are not  standardized and vary in  their components and biological activity in part this is because propolis varies with the species of plants available in each region from which the bees collect resins to produce it [  ] however standardized propolis products have recently become available to help fill the need for a product that does not vary in the main bioactive components and effectiveness [ ] one such option a standardized brazilian propolis extract blend   has been tested for safety and effectiveness in clinical trials for  treating  kidney  disease  and  diabetes     denture  stomatitis     and  burn  patients    therefore propolis as a nutraceutical or functional food should be considered as a

drugs may act as nep inhibitors  induced ï¬t docking ifdsp after the virtual docking studies based on the ligand interac tion and binding energy of the eight drugs four ligands showing good values were taken forward for induced ï¬t docking ifd in virtual docking protocol the interactions occur between the bind ing site of the rigid protein and the ï¬exible ligand but this is not the case with the actual ligandprotein interactions in the body where the target protein undergoes backbone or sidechain move ments after binding with ligands this induces alteration in binding sites of the protein also in the body the ligand binding site on the proteins conforms to the ligand shape and binding mode ifd was conducted to resolve the shortcomings of rigid docking pro tocols ifd has two main applications ï¬rst it generates the most accurate  active  complex  structure  of  ligand  which  is  not  possi ble in virtual molecular docking with rigid protein structure sec ond ifd avoids falsenegative results of virtual docking in virtual docking screening of the ligands was done with the single confor mation of ligands however in ifd  conï¬rmers were generated for each ligand hence ifdsp was carried for zinc0        zinc0      zinc0       and  zinc0     and a maximum of  conformers were generated for each ligand based on molecular docking and binding energy further the ifd score

molecular  dynamics  is  used  to  simulate  ligandprotein  com plexes in presence of systems with biological relevance it includes the  explicit  solvent  representation  with  the  entire  protein  the main advantage of md stimulation is that it represents the actual conditions of the biological system it provides a highly dynamic protein structure and the ligandprotein complex is solvated with water as happens in the biological system    ifd however pro vides limited ï¬exibility which is insuï¬cient to mimic the actual conditions  of  a  biological  system  hence  md  simulation  studies were carried out to get insights into the top four drugs in terms of binding stability and nonbonding interactions with crucial amino acid within the drugbinding pocket of nep protein in a dynamic

sarscov    the world health anization  who named the disease caused by sarscov2 as coronavirus disease  covid19 until april   the virus has swept through  countries more than  million cases with covid19 have been confirmed and more than   cases died which has been posing significant threats to public health sarscov2 can cause respiratory diseases and may lead to acute respiratory distress

patients   angiotensin converting enzyme  ace2 as a metalloproteinase is a carboxyterminal dipeptidyl peptidase   the primary physiological role of ace2 is involved in the regulation of vasoconstriction and blood pressure  []  transmembrane  protease  serine  type2  tmprss2 belonging to the type ii transmembrane serine protease family could cleave  the  coronavirus  spike  s  protein  []  it  was  demonstrated that ace2 and tmprss2 were crucial for the entry of sarscov and sarscov2 into the host cells   cell entry of sarscov2 depends on binding of the s protein to the specific cellular receptor and s protein priming by host cell proteases as shown in fig  each s protein of sarscov2 consists of two subunits a globular s1 domain at the nterminal region and the membraneproximal s2 domain sarscov2 utilizes receptorbinding domain within the s1 domain to bind to the cellular receptor ace2 which could trigger the effects of tmprss2 on the cleavage of protein s at the s1 and s2 sites and priming cell membrane fusion for viral entry   as receptors and mediators of virus entry are important for determining viral host and an the route of sarscov2 infection and the infected an may depend on the expression and distribution of ace2 and tmprss2   studies have shown that ace2 and tmprss2 are expressed not only in lung tissues but also in extrapulmonary ans including heart kidney liver colon esophagus brain gallbladder and testis suggesting that sarscov2 may also affect extrapulmonary ans [] in this review the distributions of ace2 and tmprss2 in extrapulmonary ans and the characteristics and clinical managements of extrapulmonary an injury caused by sarscov2 were summarized we believe that this will be important in understanding on the infection of extrapulmonary ans in patients with covid19  the mrna expressions of ace2 and tmprss2 in extrapulmonary ans the mrna expressions of ace2 in different human ans were analyzed and the results showed that ace2 was expressed in the heart   furthermore chen   analyzed the feature of ace2 expressions among cardiac cell types and found that ace2 was specifically expressed in pericyte   moreover rna sequencing from  patients with failing hearts and  normal donors revealed that myocardial ace2 expressions were significantly increased in patients with heart failure which was further validated at the protein level by proteomics profiling from   heart  failure  and    normal donors     another  study  also showed that the expression of ace2 in heart tissues of patients with underlying heart disease was higher than that in normal heart tissues   these two studies suggested that the expression of ace2 in heart tissue of patients with underlying heart disease was higher than that in normal  heart  tissue  guo  et  al  analyzed  the  mrna  expression  of tmprss2 from the genotypetissue expression gtex database and the results showed that tmprss2 is also expressed in the heart   by singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq to profile the gene expression landscapes of  cardiac cells from human embryos qi   revealed that the cardiomyocytes from the heart contain  ace2expressed cells and   tmprss2expressed cells and the cardiovascular progenitor cells and     cells tmprss2expressed cells respectively   these data showed that both ace2 and tmprss2 were expressed in the heart contain      ace2expressed  kidney studying  the  viral  susceptibility  of  extrapulmonary  ans  is important for a deeper understanding for the pathogenesis of sarscov   infection

and tmprss2  were  expressed  in  the  brain  and heart ace2 expression is expressed at a relative low level in hepatocytes and mainly located in cholangiocytes while tmprss2 is expressed in the hepatocytes and cholangiocytes ace2 and tmprss2 were highly expressed in kidney and intestinal  epithelial  cells  both  ace2  and tmprss2 were also expressed in the esophagus stomach nose testis pancreas breast prostate and thyroid   results showed that the ace2 was distributed across multiple cell types and  was  mostly  enriched  in  proximal  tubule  cells     fan  et  al confirmed the specific ace2 expression in tubular cells from the gene expression omnibus geo dataset while it was not observed in immune cells and glomerular parietal epithelial cells rna and protein expression data of ace2 in different human tissues and cancer cell lines were obtained from three online datasets including the cancer cell line encyclopedia  ccle  gtex  database  and  the  human  protein  atlas dataset and the results indicated that both mrna and protein expression levels of ace2 were relatively high in kidney cells especially in renal tubular cells   meanwhile suryawanshi   analyzed the data  of kidney  tissues in scrnaseq  datasets and found  that either proximal  tubular  cells  or  tubular  progenitor  cells  in  the  kidney coexpressed ace2 and tmprss2   the data of the scrnaseq from geo dataset gse134355 showed that ace2 and tmprss2 expression levels were high in nephron epithelial cells epithelial cells endothelial cells and mesangial cells of the kidney   recently pan   also found that the tmprss2 gene was coexpressed with ace2 in kidney podocytes   these data showed that both ace2 and tmprss2 were highly expressed in tissues and cells of kidney  liver chai  et  al  analyzed  the  scrnaseq  data  from  geo  database gse124395  to  evaluate ace2  gene  expression  in  liver the  results showed that ace2 was highly expressed in cholangiocytes which level was about  times higher than that in hepatocytes   the gtex database also showed that both ace2 and tmprss2 were expressed in the liver   zhou   identified that tmprss2 is highly expressed in hepatocytes from human cell atlas database   recently wen   indicated  that  ace2  and  tmprss2  are  specifically  coexpression  in trop2 liver progenitors of human liver tissue using scrna sequencing   these data indicate that ace2 expression is expressed at a relative low level in hepatocytes and mainly located in cholangiocytes while tmprss2 is expressed in hepatocytes  digestive tract a previous study showed that ace2 could be found in the upper esophagus and it could be detected in stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes of the ileum and colon   quantitative mrna expression profiling of ace2 across  human tissues by harmer   showed that ace2 was expressed at a high level in gastrointestinal tissues     zhang  et  al  analyzed    datasets  with  singlecell  transcriptomes of esophagus gastric ileum colon and lung and the data showed that ace2 was not only highly expressed in the type ii alveolar cells  at2  of  lung  but  also  in  the  stratified  epithelial  cells  ileum absorptive enterocytes cells and colon enterocytes   similarly the immunofluorescent  staining  of  esophagus  stomach  duodenum  and rectum  showed  that  ace2  was  stained  mainly  in  the  cytoplasm  of gastrointestinal  epithelial  cells     besides  the  scrnaseq  data showed that ace2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes     guo  et  al  suggested  that  tmprss2  was  highly expressed in almost all ans of the digestive tract including colon stomach  small  intestine  and  esophagus     using  published scrnaseq data and seven inhouse normal colon samples lee   reported that the coexpressions of ace2 and tmprss2 transcripts were mainly observed in the small intestine and colon   the highest expressions of tmprss2 and ace2 were found in enterocytes among the intestinal cell types  these data showed that tmprss2 and aec2 are highly expressed in the digestive tract  nervous system analysis using the gtex database showed that both tmprss2 and ace2 are expressed at relatively low levels in the brain cortex   chen   found that ace2 was relatively highly expressed in some important brain areas such as the substantia nigra and brain ventricles using seven brain transcriptome databases   ace2 was expressed at high level in the piriform cortex of human brain and its expression could also be detected in many neurons including both excitatory and inhibitory neurons and some nonneuron cells including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex   qi   analyzed the scrnaseq

and cortex   there are limited reports on the expressions of ace2 and tmprss2 in peripheral nervous system brann   analyzed the ace2 and tmprss2 expression in different cell type from human scrnaseq dataset gse139522 and found that neither olfactory sensory neurons nor olfactory bulb neurons expressed these two genes while ace2 and tmprss2 were expressed in the nonneuronal cells including the sustentacular cells and olfactory  bulb  pericytes     these  data  showed  that  ace2  and tmprss2 could also be coexpressed in the nervous system  other ans or tissues table  characteristics of

tmprss2 were also reported to be coexpressed in some other ans   it has been revealed that both ace2 and tmprss2 are expressed in testis by scrna sequencing and expression profile analysis indicating that testicular cells might be the potential targets of sarscov2 another report revealed that multiple kinds of cells in the nose including nasal brushing epithelial cells nasal turbinate epithelial cells and nasal airway epithelial cells contained ace2expressed and tmprss2expressed cell clusters   moreover ace2 and tmprss2 were also expressed in pancreas breast prostate and thyroid   and these ans might also be the targets of sarscov2  infection of sarscov2 and extrapulmonary an injury of patients with covid19  sarscov2 infection and cardiac injury recently autopsy analysis by fox   revealed that the histopathology of the heart was consistent with the typical pattern of viral myocarditis   sarscov2 rna was detected in the cardiac tissues of  the  patients  with  covid19     these  data  suggested  that sarscov2 may directly infect heart the epidemiology of covid19 reported that cardiac injury was one of the most severe an damages   the clinical manifestations of cardiac injury in covid19 patients are complex and could present with heart failure arrhythmias or acute myocardial infarction ami [ ] inciardi   reported the first case who had the symptom of heart failure at first and later the patient was positive for sarscov2 using nucleic acid test   cardiac injury is a common symptom in patients with covid19 shi   reported that    patients with covid19 had cardiac injury   moreover there were      patients  with  acute  cardiac  injury  in  a  cohort  including   covid19 patients and    of  patients with acute cardiac injury in the intensive care unit icu   furthermore a study by wang   showed that there were    patients with acute cardiac injury and    patients presented with arrhythmia of  covid19 patients while acute cardiac injury was observed in    of  patients  with  civid19  in  the  icu     these  cases  suggested  that sarscov2 may cause serious heart damage which should be widespreadly concerned furthermore acute cardiac injury is more prevalent in severe cases with covid19 [] table  and it has been reported that covid19 patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury   in this review we also summarized the possible relationship between basic heart disease and further cardiac injury [] table  in a cohort  of    covid19  patients  from  renmin  hospital  of  wuhan university china shi   demonstrated that cardiac injury occurred in  patients during hospitalization of which    had basic heart disease including coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure and only    patients with basic heart disease of  covid19 patients without cardiac injury   similarly liu   suggested that    patients with basic heart disease in  covid19 patients had table  comorbidity with cardiac injury in covid19 patients with basic heart disease  subjects with covid19 proportion of basic heart disease patients with cardiacinjury                                    study shi     liu     xu     ma     guo     patients

without cardiac injury   other studies also indicated that the patients with basic cardiovascular disease are more likely to present heat injury in covid19 patients [ ] in view of the points above covid19 patients with underlying cardiac conditions seem to have higher rates of cardiac injury  sarscov2 infection and kidney injury recently autopsy analysis on six covid19 patients showed that varying degrees of acute tubular necrosis were observed in all the renal specimens nucleoprotein np antigens and np positive inclusion body of sarscov2 could be seen in kidney tissues from all the samples moreover  viruslike  ps  were  seen  in  kidney  tissues  by  transmission electronic microscope tem   su   analyzed kidney abnormalities in  autopsies of patients with covid19 and found that diffuse proximal tubular damage with the loss of brush border were biomedicinepharmacotherapy13120201106784 0c sarscov2 infection and liver injury m dong                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     observed further investigation showed that diffuse necrosis can be seen under the light microscope and electron microscopic examination also showed the clusters of coronavirus ps with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes   it was reported that both np antigens and rna of sarscov2 were detected in urine of covid19 patients     these  data  coincide  with  the  finding  of  the sarscov2 invasion in kidney collectively sarscov2 could directly infect human renal tubules and lead to kidney damage recent studies have shown that the incidence of acute kidney injury aki in covid19 patients ranged from    and higher frequency of renal function damage with elevated blood urea nitrogen bun or serum creatinine scr was observed in covid19 patients [ ]  table    a  study  of    patients  with covid19 indicated that levels of bun and scr were increased in    and    patients with covid19 respectively and routine urine tests were performed on  patients among which    patients were positive for urinary protein and    patients were positive for hematuria   another study also showed that about   patients with covid19 had abnormal renal function   moreover covid19 patients with more severe disease progression have higher rates of aki huang and colleagues reported that    of  patients with aki in the icu were observed and none of the  patients who did not require care in the icu suffered aki   xu   found that the fatality rate was obviously higher in covid19 patients with aki than those without renal injury   furthermore in another study investigating  patients with covid19 at hospital admission more severe patients had higher rates of aki and the cox regression analysis also suggested that covid19 patients who developed aki had a significantly higher mortality risk   therefore aki is more prevalent in severe cases with covid19 an autopsy report of a 50yearold patient with covid19 showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular activity in liver tissues   moreover zhao   used human liver ductal anoids as a tool  to  investigate  the  sarscov2  infection  and  the  tissue  damage induced  by  sarscov2  ex  vivo  and  the  results  showed  that  the expression of sarscov2 np was easily detected in the patchy areas of the hepatic duct indicating that liver ductal anoids were susceptible to sarscov2 infection   in addition sarscov2 infection could disrupt  the  barrier  and  bile  acid  transporting  functions  of  cholangiocytes  which  indicated  that  sarscov2  might  directly  induce cholangiocyte injury and consequently bile acid accumulation   in view of the points above liver damage in the covid19 patients might be directly caused by the viral infection abnormal  liver  functions  were  frequently  reported  in  covid19 patients   epidemiologic studies showed that almost half of the patients had differing degrees of liver damage [ ] table  chen   reported that    out of  patients had elevated alanine aminotransferase alt    patients had elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast and    had elevated total bilirubin tbil in wuhan jinyintan hospital wuhan china   similarly a nationwide study involving  patients with covid19 in china showed that more than   of patients had elevated alt and ast and   of patients had elevated tbil   it was revealed that the levels of direct bilirubin indirect bilirubin alt alkaline phosphatase  alp  and  gammaglutamyltransferase  ggt  were  significantly higher in males than that in females with covid19 and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male was an important independent risk factor for predicting acute liver injury ali in covid19 patients     these  data  indicated  that  male  patients  with covid19  may  be  more  susceptible  to  liver  injury  furthermore table  characteristics of acute kidney injury after sarscid0 cov2 infection  study chen wang huang guan xu preexisting kidney conditions na    na    na                     country

another study xing   reported that sarscov2 rna was detected in the feces of three pediatric cases with covid19 in qingdao china and the persistence of sarscov2 in the digestive tract lasted for 6cid0  days   the possibility of fecaloral transmission of sarscov2 infection needs to be taken into account furthermore as shown in table  long duration of sarscov2 detection in digestive tract by rtpcr has been reported and viral rna remained detectable in the digestive tract for 2cid0  days after nucleic acid turned negative in respiratory samples [] the studies suggested that sarscov2 could be detected from respiratory tract specimens during the early period to digestive tract specimens during the late period and viral nucleic acid tests in both the respiratory and digestive tract are necessary to confirm the complete clearance of virus some covid19 patients presented gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal pain   holshue   reported  the  first  case  of  covid19  patient  in  the  usa  which  had nausea and vomiting before admission   multiple studies found that gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea    nausea and vomiting    and abdominal pain    were common at presentation in covid19 patients [ ] table  in a cohort of  patients with covid19 in wuhan china gastrointestinal symptoms were described in up to     moreover sun

of patients without gi   jin   also found that the rate of the severe type was markedly higher in covid19 patients with gi symptoms than that in those without gi symptoms   these data suggested that gi is one of the common extrapulmonary an injuries in covid19 patients and may be related to the severity of the disease on the other hand many studies showed that patients with covid19 could present initially with the typical gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea may even occur earlier than pyrexia or respiratory symptom in some cases with covid19 [] luo   reported that  of  covid19 cases presented initially only with  gastrointestinal  symptoms     the  covid19  patients  initially only with gastrointestinal symptoms are more difficult to diagnose and might  be  overlooked  which  could  lead  to  potentially  serious consequences together digestive tract symptoms especially diarrhea are  the  main  complications  of  covd19  patients  which  should  be noticed during the outbreak of covid19  sarscov2 infection and nervous system injury transmission electron microscopy of autopsy sections showed the presence of sarscov2 virallike ps in frontal lobe brain and neural cell bodies   moreover researchers confirmed the presence of sarscov2 in cerebrospinal fluid by genome sequencing   the pathological mechanism may be the invasion of sarscov2 into the nervons system the virallike ps in brain capillary endothelium  was  also  observed     which  suggested  that  hematogenous route might act as the pathway for sarscov2 to the brain in addition study using the mouse model have shown that sarscov can lead to neuroinvasion via disruption of the nasal epithelium and subsequent neuronal dissemination   which suggested that coronavirus may use the olfactory nerve to enter the brain the symptoms from nervous system of covid19 patients including headache dizziness anosmia and dysgeusia have been observed in the clinic  []  table    disturbance  of consciousness

7532,Colon_Cancer, recently the current pandemic of coronavirus disease  covid  characterized by a pulmonary infection in humans is caused by a novel  virus  strain  from  family  coronaviridae  known  as  severe  acute respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus    sarscov2  the  previous outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in  and  middle  east  respiratory  syndrome  mers  in    has  demonstrated the lethality of coronaviruses when they cross the species barrier and infect humans   so far six coronaviruses infecting humans have been identified and the novel coronavirus is the seventh one described to date  as  being responsible for a  respiratory infection  sarscov and merscov  and  the  new  sarscov2  belong  to  the  betacoronavirus family [] the coronaviruses have the largest genome around  k among the rna viruses sarscov2 was closely related from   identity to two batderived severe acute respiratory syndrome sarslike coronaviruses batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 but it was more distant from sarscov from  and merscov about     furthermore the performed bioinformatic analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence of sarscov2 is similar to those of other

disease and on preventing and controlling the replication and spread of the virus to  devise  therapeutic  strategies  to  counteract  the  sarscov2 infection numerous potential treatment options are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials many antiviral and immunological treatments being investigated against coronaviruses are summarized by who in landscape analysis of therapeutics as of march   the realtime dashboard of completed ongoing and planned clinical trials for covid    includes drugs and promising therapies such as remdesevir lopinavirritonavir  hydroxychloroquine  il6  inhibitors  tocilizumab and  sarilumab  convalescent  plasma  therapy  stemcell  transfusion vaccine candidates traditional chinese medicines which are of top  interventions of the presented network among them remdesivir an analogue of adenosine seems to have a more promising future due to proven in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy till the beginning of june   promising  therapies  involving  lopinavirritonavir  and  chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were part of treatment guidelines in many countries but currently they are excluded from covid19 treatment protocols because of uncertainty regarding their risks and benefits and it is recommended that they should be used only in the context of clinical trials [] in spite of its known in vitroin vivo efficacy and safety profiles  some  trials  evaluating  these  drugs  for  covid19  infection treatment uk ntc04381936 and discovery inserm ntc04315948 discontinued hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirritonavir arms the interim trial results showed that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirritonavir produced little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized covid19 patients when  compared  to  standard  of  care  nevertheless  some  countries worldwide continue to recommend chloroquinehydroxychloroquine as a treatment option [] the existing drugs that target viral proteins associated with enzymatic activities or blocking viral replication machinery or host proteins involved in viral life cycle regulating the function of the immune system or other cellular processes in host cells have great potential and are available on the market our review aims to highlight the potential molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic options available for the cure of other health conditions and their repurposing for the treatment of this novel coronavirus sars cov2  selected treatments of sarscov2  remdesivir gs5734  polymerase inhibitor deltacoronavirus genus pdcov which have the most divergent rdrp of known cov as compared to sars and merscov   an in silico test of  the  covid19  rdrp  built  model  suggested  the  effectiveness  of remdesivir  as  a  potent  drug     sarscov  and  sarscov2  both belong to the betacoronaviruses of the b lineage and the rdrp amino acid sequences of the two viruses are   identical whereas merscov belongs to the betacoronaviruses of the c lineage and is only   identical with sarscov2   another in vitro and in vivo proof came from sheahan   who examined if gs5734 could inhibit replication of sarscov and mers cov in primary human airway epithelial hae cell cultures they found out a dosedependent reduction in replication with average ic50 values of   Î¼m  sarscov  and   Î¼m  merscov  moreover  the compound inhibits a broad range of diverse cov including circulating human zoonotic bat cov and prepandemic zoonotic cov with both prophylactic and therapeutic 1dpi dosing of gs5734 a reduction in replication below a diseasecausing threshold in mouse model of sars cov pathogenesis was demonstrated therapeutic gs5734 substantially reduced  the  sarscov  induced  weight  loss  in  infected  animals  and significantly  suppressed  virus  lung  titers  p    thus  demonstrating that therapeutic administration of gs5734 can reduce disease and suppress replication during an ongoing infection   furthermore remdesivir has the potential to block sarscov2 infection in vitro at lowmicromolar concentration   and in treatment of merscov and sarscov infections in vivo it demonstrated a significant improvement of pulmonary pathology in mice   the rnadependent rna polymerase rdrpmediated mechanism of cov inhibition by gs5734 is proven even in the setting of intact exoribonuclease  exonmediated  proofreading  using  the  model coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv it was demonstrated that gs5734 dramatically inhibited viral replication and viral rna synthesis in wildtype wt virus while an nsp14 exon mutant lacking proofreading  demonstrated  increased  susceptibility  to  gs5734  45fold more active this suggests that gs5734 is recognized at least partially by a functional exon but that the exon activity is not sufficient to prevent potent inhibition of cov replication the results provide strong evidence that rdrp is the target for remdesivir and support the hypothesis that gs5734 directly inhibits viral rna synthesis   the mechanism of inhibition of rdrp of merscov by remdesivir was  studied  by  gordon  et  al  they  coexpressed  the  merscov nonstructural proteins nsp5 nsp7 nsp8 and nsp12 rdrp in insect cells as a part of a polyprotein coexpression of the mers nsp5 protease with  nsp7  nsp8  and  nsp12  in  insect  cells  yielded  a  stable  complex composed of nsp8 and nsp12 the triphosphate form of the inhibitor rdvtp is utilized as a substrate and competes with its natural counterpart  atp  and  they  observed  that  incorporation  of  the  nucleotide analogue was significantly more efficient once added into the growing rna chain the inhibitor does not cause immediate chain termination the presence of the ²hydroxyl group allows the addition of three more nucleotides until rna synthesis is arrested at position i3 therefore the main possible mechanism of action is delayed rna chain termination   recently the same authors obtained almost identical results with  sarscov merscov and  sarscov2 rdrps  they  provided evidence that all three coronavirus rdrp complexes terminated rna synthesis at position i3   almost all viruses encode polymerases in the central steps of replication and transcription therefore polymerases are becoming the most attractive and suitable targets for antiviral development there are two major  types  of  polymerase  inhibitors  i  nucleoside  and  nucleotide substrate analogs and ii allosteric inhibitors nucleoside analogs are first triphosphated by the host cell to produce the active inhibitor and then act as an inhibitor by competing with the natural nucleoside triphosphates and terminating the growing viral nucleic acids to date most of the approved antiviral drugs for antihiv therapy utilize this mechanism     remdesivir  is  a  nucleotide  analogue  with  a  proved mechanism  of  action  as  an  inhibitor  of  rnadependent  rna remdesivir  rdv  is  an  investigational  compound  with  a  broad spectrum of antiviral activities against rna viruses including sarscov and merscov gs5734 was originally developed for the treatment of the ebola virus disease gs5734 the single sp isomer of the 2ethylbutyl lalaninate phosphoramidate prodrug effectively bypasses the rate limiting  first  phosphorylation  step  of  the  nuc  nucleoside  ribose analogue  the  mechanism  of  action  of  nuc  requires  intracellular anabolism to the active triphosphate metabolite ntp which is expected  to  interfere  with  the  activity  of  viral  rnadependent  rna polymerases  rdrp     gs5734  selectively  inhibits  ebola  virus replication by targeting its rdrp and inhibiting viral rna synthesis following efficient intracellular conversion to ntp in nonhuman primates this compound shows a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against several rna viruses including respiratory syncytial virus rsv junÃ­n virus lassa fever virus and middle east respiratory syndrome virus  but  was  inactive  against  alphaviruses  or  retroviruses    furthermore  remdesivir  dosedependently  inhibits  endemic  human cov229e  and  covoc43  replications  which  typically  cause  upper respiratory infection in children but can cause more severe lower respiratory infection in adults with underlying respiratory conditions ie asthma  copd  and  the  elderly  as  well  as  a  member  of  the biomedicinepharmacotherapy13120201106682 0c lopinavirritonavir  protease inhibitor the proteases encoded by most viruses play a crucial role in the viral life cycle the protease inhibitors pis bind competitively to the substrate site of the viral protease this enzyme is responsible for the post  translational proteolysis of a polyprotein precursor and the release of functional viral proteins allowing them to function correctly and individually in replicationtranscription and maturation inhibition results in the production of immature virus ps   coronavirus proteases  of  which  there  are  two  in  sarscov  a  papainlike  cysteine proteinase plpro nsp3 and a 3clike proteinase 3clpro or mpro nsp5  and  three  in  several  other  coronaviruses  cleave  the  orf1 polypeptide  as  it  is  translated  enabling  the  formation  of  the  viral replication  complex     the  substratebinding  pockets  are  highly conserved  among  cov  3clpro  suggesting  the  possibility  for  a widespectrum inhibitor design targeting this region in the 3clpro of all covs  it  is  postulated  that  the  3clproinhibiting  activity  of  lopinavirritonavir contributes at least partially to its anticov effects   in silico binding studies of the drugs using the identified crystal structure of mpro and employing the hex program to conduct the docking of the ligands to the sarscov main proteinase revealed that lopinavir and ritonavir could basically bind to the active site of sars main proteinase but the efficacy of lopinavirritonavir was predicted to be poor   according  to  the  latest  report  of  the  structure  of  3clpro  from sarscov2 pdb code 6lu7 and the available structure of 3clpro from sarscov pdb code 1uk4 the two main proteases differ by only  amino acids comparing ligand binding free energies for the main proteases has confirmed that good binders for sarscov are in general and sarscov k uzunova

biochemical data provided by gordon     suggested a unifying mechanism of inhibition of sarscov merscov and sarscov2 fig  and future emerging covs may be similarly susceptible to the inhibition by remdesivir   comparable replication  with also good binders for sarscov2 3clpro   protease inhibitors  a class of drugs best known for success against hiv  block the final step of virion assembly in the treatment of human immunodeficiency  virus  infection  with  proven  efficacy     the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir is widely used as a boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of hiv infection because of low oral bioavailability of lopinavir and its extensive metabolism by the cyp3a4 isoenzyme lopinavir needs to be coadministered with ritonavir to achieve drug concentrations high enough to inhibit viral replication [ ] so far the reported results from studies in different cell lines animal models and patients for lopinavirritonavir are not so convincing in their inhibition action in human coronaviruses screening the library of  fdaapproved drugs for antimerscov activity in cell culture has identified four compounds chloroquine chlorpromazine loperamide and  lopinavir  which  inhibit  merscov  replication      effective concentration ec50  3cid0  Î¼moll in vitro lopinavir inhibited mers cov efficacy ec50   Î¼m and a maximal protective effect were observed at a dose of  Î¼m   it was previously shown that lopinavir but not ritonavir inhibit sarscov chymotrypsinlike 3cl protease at the concentration of   Î¼m     moreover  it  was  suggested  that  lopinavir  blocks  a postentry  step  in  the  merscov  replicative  cycle  in  vitro     the detectable antiviral activities of ribavirin rimantadine lopinavir and baicalin were shown by using the frhk4 cell line   and in vero e6 cells infected with sarscov2 lopinavir inhibit replication with ec50 at  Î¼m   during the sars outbreak treatment with lopinavir in combination with  ritonavir  was  explored  with  some  success  in  nonrandomized clinical  trials     patients  with  sarscov  treated  with  lopinavirritonavir showed a progressive decrease of viral load and reduction of the composite adverse outcome at day    recently the antiviral activity of remdesivir and ifn was found to be superior to that of lopinavirritonavirifn against merscov in vitro and in vivo   the  efficacy  of  lopinavirritonavir  with  or  without  ribavirin  is evaluated  in  sarscov2  patients  under  randomized  control  trials currently it was demonstrated that this combination has no benefits in adult patients with severe covid19   although protease inhibitors are  a  common  class  of  medication  used  in  the  treatment  of  hiv1 infection  their  efficacy  in  human  coronavirus  infections  is  not convincing moreover several antihiv pis are also known to influence other intracellular pathways it was demonstrated that hiv protease inhibitors  indinavir  saquinavir and  lopinavir independently  from any  viral infection  can hinder  lymphocyte  apoptosis by  influencing mitochondrial homeostasis in view of the weak antiviral activity of protease inhibitors further studies should be done to ascertain whether the clinical benefit could be attributed to their antiapoptotic rather than their antiviral activity   hence even if the molecular target of lopinavirritonavir  is  the  main  protease  3clpro  in  sarscov2 infected cells fig  there are no biochemical and molecular studies confirming the interaction and associating this with clinical efficacy of the protease inhibitor  chloroquinehydroxychloroquine chloroquine chq was introduced into clinical practice in  as a prophylactic treatment for malaria hydroxychloroquine hcq differs from chloroquine by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain the nethyl substituent is hydroxylated currently chq and its hydroxyl form hcq are used as antiinflammatory agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus and amoebic hepatitis   in addition chq has been studied as a potent antiviral agent against hiv1aids [] hcov229e   sarscov [ ] influenza a h5n1virus

overall more than  trials currently underway  around  the  world  on  its  impact  either  as  a  prophylactic  or treatment  for  covid19  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  usefulness  of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine is intensively investigated   chloroquine was found to exert an antiviral effect during pre and postinfection  conditions  suggesting  to  have  both  prophylactic  and therapeutic advantages timeofaddition assay demonstrated that chq functioned  at  both  entry  and  postentry  stages  of  the  sarscov2 infection in vero e6 cells   however it did not reduce viral replication  in  sarscov  infected  mice     hydroxychloroquine  is significantly  more  potent  than  chq  in  vitro  ec50  values    and  Î¼m  respectively  and  has  a  lower  potential  for  drugdrug  interactions than chloroquine pharmacokinetic models demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine sulfate is significantly superior  days in advance to chloroquine phosphate in inhibiting sarscov2 in vitro   and was demonstrated to be much less   toxic than chq in animals   on the other hand data presented by liu   demonstrated that the antiviral effect of hcq against sarscov2 infection was comparable with chq in vitro cc50  Î¼m and  Î¼m for chq and hcq respectively moreover they suggested that both chq and hcq blocked the transport of sarscov2 from early endosomes ees to endolysosomes els and caused noticeable sizemorphological changes in ees and els they surmised that endosome maturation might be blocked at intermediate stages of endocytosis resulting in failure of further transport of virions to the ultimate releasing site   hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine apart from the probable role of chq and hcq as antiviral agents their mechanisms of action are not fully understood and it was demonstrated that they have multiple effects on mammalian cells   ace2 is known to be a cell receptor for sarscov   the high similarities of the amino acid sequences and predicted protein structures of the receptorbinding domain of sarscov2 and sarscov suggest that sarscov2 may efficiently use human ace2 as a receptor for cellular entry and employ the cellular serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming   zhou   confirmed that sarscov2 used the ace2 receptor to enter cells and did not use other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase n apn and dipeptidyl peptidase  dpp4   so the primary mechanism by which cell infection is prevented by these drugs may be at the stage of binding with the surface receptor and endosomemediated viral entry two independent in vitro studies confirmed that chq inhibits the replication of the sarscov chloroquine inhibits the early stage of sarscov replication in vero e6 cells with a   effective concentration of  ±  Î¼ml the antiviral activity of chq was indicative at the time point at virus attachment or penetration   vincent   established that the drug might interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor ace2 when chq was added prior to infection the impairment of terminal glycosylation of ace2 may result in reduced binding  affinities  between  ace2  and  sarscov  spike  protein  and negatively influence the initiation of sarscov infection when chq or nh4cl were added after infection these agents could rapidly raise the ph and interrupt ongoing fusion events between the virus and endosomes thus inhibiting the infection on the basis of in vitro experiments they suggested that the primary mechanism by which infection was prevented  was  the  poor  affinity  of  sarscov  spike  protein  to underglycosylated ace2   in vitro studies with hiv infected cells also identified that inhibition of glycosylation might be a possible mechanism of action of chq chq inhibits hiv replication at a postintegration stage resulting in the production of immature virions   it was demonstrated that the sole mechanism explaining the antihiv activity of chq was a decrease in the infectivity of the newly produced virus associated with defective production of the heavily glycosylated 2g12 epitope of gp120   according  to  in  vitro  results  the  antiretroviral  effects  of  chq  are attributable to the inhibition of viral p glycosylation these effects appeared to be specific since the chq concentrations effective in vitro neither affected any other step in hiv1 replication nor were cytotoxic    thus  there  is  direct  evidence  that  chq  is  an  inhibitor  of glycosylation of gp120 and these alterations may be responsible for the decreased infectivity of hiv grown in the presence of chloroquine when added after the initiation of infection these drugs might affect the endosomemediated fusion and subsequent virus replication   sarscov pseudoviruses may enter cells via receptordependent clathrin  and  caveolaeindependent  phsensitive  endocytosis  likely through a process involving lipid rafts   a later study however suggests  that  the  entry  of  coronaviruses  into  the  host  cells  occurs through clathrinmediated endocytosis murine hepatitis virus mhv a prototypic member of the cov family requires trafficking to lysosomes for  proteolytic cleavage  at the  fp proximal  position of  its spike  s protein membrane fusion to occur   many authors indicated that s protein cleavage is an important step for fusion activity and subsequent internalization of the sarscov virus genome into cells [] adding chq prior to infection results to inhibition of endosome maturation and  strongly  decreased  mhv  infection  and  fusion  which  was  not observed when the drug was added at  hpi indicating that the compound mainly affects mhv entry   chloroquine is a weak base that is known to increase the ph of lysosomal   and transgolgi network tgn vesicles leading to the dysfunction  of  enzymes  necessary  for  proteolytic  processing  and posttranslational  modifications  of  newly  synthesized  viral  proteins chloroquine is able to prevent the processing of prm protein to m protein in flavivirusinfected mammalian and mosquito cells by raising the ph of the postgolgi vesicles in which this cleavage occurs as a result virions from infected cells which had been treated with acidotropic amines late in the virus replication cycle contained prm protein rather than m protein and this reduced the infectivity of the virus   the chloroquinemediated rise in endosomal ph modulates iron metabolism in a variety of cell types decreasing in intracellular concentration of iron affects the function of several cellular enzymes involved in pathways leading to the replication of cellular dna and to the expression of different genes [] autophagy is a lysosomedependent degradative pathway chq and its analogue hcq are known clinically relevant autophagy inhibitors chq is a weak base that inhibits lysosomal acidification which prevents the  fusion  of  autophagosomes  with  lysosomes  and  subsequent  autophagic  degradation     inhibition  of  autophagy  with  chq stimulates  superoxide  generation  ubiquitinconjugated  protein  accumulation and apoptosis in a colon cancer xenograft model   chq treatment clearly inhibited autophagy in mouse lung and efficiently ameliorated acute lung injury and dramatically improved the survival rate in mice infected with live avian influenza a h5n1 virus   h5n1 virusinduced autophagic cell death in alveolar epithelial cells through a pathway involving the kinase akt the tumor suppressor protein tsc2 and the mammalian target of rapamycin and autophagyblocking agents might be useful as prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of humans by the h5n1 virus   furthermore prentice   suggested that authophagy was induced by the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv  and  was  required  for  formation  of  double  membranebound mhv  replication  complexes  which  significantly  enhanced  the  efficiency of replication replication of the virus was impaired in atg5 knockout embryonic stem cells   the same authors also examined the sarscovs and found out similar colocalization of the key viral replication proteins with endogenous lc3 a protein marker for autophagosome   it could be assumed that autophagy inhibitors like chq could inhibit virus replication at present the exact role of autophagy in cov infection remains debatable and there is much evidence suggesting that the endocytic pathway plays a key role in mediating viral  entry  for  many  covs  including  sarscovs  merscovs  and possibly sarscov2   the  antiinflammatory  properties  of  chqhcq  should  also  be considered several studies have suggested that multiple an failure biomedicinepharmacotherapy13120201106684 0chas not yet been identified in sarscov2 infected patients and probably multiple pathways could be involved fig   conclusion the  sarscov2  is  the  cause  of  the  coronavirus  disease   covid19 that has been declared a global pandemic by the world health anization who in  despite some clinical characteristics  that  differentiate  covid19  from  sarscov  merscov  and seasonal  influenza     the  pathogen  sarscov2  has  the  same phylogenetic  similarity  to  sarscov  and  mers  cov  most  of  the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between sarscov2 and  the  related  batderived  coronaviruses  batslcovzc45  and batslcovzxc21  a  notable  difference  was  a  longer  spike  protein encoded by sarscov2 compared with the bat sarslike coronaviruses sarscov and merscov in addition sarscov2 was distinct from sarscov in a phylogeny of the complete rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp gene   moreover the receptorbinding domain of sarscov2 which directly engages the ace2 receptor for cell entry was more closely related to those of sarscovs   amino acid identity   since the outbreak researchers have released many agents that could have potential efficacy against covid19 there is currently no clinically proven specific antiviral agent available for sarscov2 infection like  sarscov  and  merscov  certain  agents  like  chloroquine hydroxychloroquine lopinavirritonavir and remdesivir are being used in  ongoing  clinical  trials  all  over  the  world  with  hopes  to  further delineate  their  role  in  the  treatment  and  prophylaxis  of  covid19 furthermore  due  to  their  availability  and  using  for  decades  and proven  safety  records  it  is  reasonable  to  suggest  that  they  may  be appropriate for treatment of covid19 remdesivir an adenosine analogue with wellstudied mechanism of action in cov infections can target the rnadependent rna polymerase and block viral rna synthesis and has been a promising antiviral drug antiviral studies in cell culture and animal models the available human safety data as well as the clear mechanism of action characterize rdv as a directacting antiviral since some authors found that lopinavirritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement   hence antiviral effects as an inhibitor of the sarscov main 3cl protease should be further investigated although chq and hcq are wellknown drugs for the treatment of k uzunova                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 observed in fatal cases are most likely associated with not only the direct viral infection and destruction of susceptible cells eg endothelial cells but also the effects of proinflammatory cytokines chemokines and other mediators released from infected and activated cells such as monocytes and macrophages   the clinical worsening of individuals with sars in week  is apparently unrelated to uncontrolled sars coronavirus replication but may be related to immunopathological damage   another study reveals that the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and the accumulation of inflammatory cells led to endotheliitis in several ans as a direct consequence of viral involvement and to host inflammatory response   moreover  chq  has  immunomodulatory  effects  suppressing  the productionrelease of tumour necrosis factorÎ± and interleukin6 which mediate the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases   chloroquinehcq  was  reported  to  inhibit  the  production  of  soluble mature tnf in macrophage cell line   inhibit tnfÎ±  receptor in human histocytic u937 cells   inhibit tnfÎ± ifnÎ³  and il6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc   reduce tnfÎ±  production and lipopolysaccharide lpsinduced il1 release in human monocytic cells   it is suggested that chq exerts antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects predominantly by pretranslational and nonlysosomotropic mechanisms   chloroquineinduced inhibition of tnf and il6 production is not mediated through a lysosomotropic mechanism and chloroquine probably acts on tnf secretion by disrupting iron homeostasis   besides its antiviral activity and due to its suppressive effects on the productionrelease of tnfÎ± and interleukin  chqhcq may be effectively used in the treatment of viral infections characterized  by  symptoms  associated  with  inflammatory  processes andor  immunehyperactivation  antiinflammatory  effects  of  chq remain  poorly  understood regulation  of proinflammatory cytokines chq can also act on the immune system through cell signaling chq inhibits the activation of p38 mapk in hcov229einfected cells and evokes the activation of erk independently of infection these results suggested that chq may inhibit cov replication by suppressing the p38 activation   additionally chq strongly inhibited phosphorylation of mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk p38 and to a lesser extent cjun nterminal kinase and extracellular signalregulated kinase ½   chloroquine could also inhibit innate  immune  responses  trough  downregulation  of  tlr9  signaling pathways requiring endocytosis and acidification of endosomes within plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs   and act as novel antagonists to  chemokine  receptor  cxcr4  that  suppress  pancreatic  cancer  cell proliferation   on the other hand another hypothesized mechanism of chq is via the inhibition of antigen degradation and improving the crosspresentation efficiency of dcs in vitro in vivo evidence suggested that a short course of treatment with chq followed by a booster dose of a soluble antigen immunization can efficiently enhance human cd8  t cell responses   and single vaccination with inactivated influenza virus combined with chloroquine treatment elicits a higher t cell immunity in mice   regulation of nlrp3 inflammasome activation may offer a promising therapeutic approach by inhibiting or slowing down the process of acute respiratory distress syndrome hcq is a known nlrp3 inhibitor and its potential clinical effectiveness is certainly based on the downregulation  of  il1  expression     the  major  proinflammatory cytokine interleukin1beta il1 is elevated in plasma from hospitalized covid19 patients and its associated signaling

particulate matter and covid19 atmospheric particulate matter pm is originated by a wide range of anthropogenic and natural sources kim  it consists of a heterogeneous mixture of solid and liquid ps suspended in air that varies continuously in size and chemical composition including nitrates sulphates elemental and anic carbon anic compounds biological compounds and metals who  it  has  been

gave first preliminary evidence that sarscov2 rna can be present on outdoor particulate matter thus suggesting that in conditions of atmospheric stability and high concentrations  of  pm  it  could  represent  a  potential  early  indicator  of covid19 although it does not give information regarding covid19 progression or severity several  observations  report  a  significant  association

by the novel coronavirus in   cities  in  china  the  authors  included  over      of dailyconfirmed new cases in the whole of china between january 23rd  and february 29th  they applied a generalized additive model gam to examine the effects of meteorological factors and air pollution on covid19 incidence applying a movingaverage approach to  capture  the  cumulative  lag  effect  of  ambient  air  pollution  and considering population size and density as potential confounders they observed that the effect of pm25 on daily confirmed cases was greater than pm10 in particular they found that a

conducted a simple linear regression to compare covid19 incidence with pm concentrations in wuhan and xiaogan from jan 26th to feb 29th in  they found that an increase in pm25 was correlated with an increase of covid19 incidence in both cities wuhan r2   p   xiaogan r2   p   while for pm10 only in xiaogan r2   p   the spatial distribution of particulate matter and case fatality rate cfr of

pm10 annual exceedances of the who threshold of  Î¼gm3 are responsible for    attributable  deaths  per  year  corresponding  to  attributable community rates of  deaths per  inhabitants per year baccini    bontempi 2020bfocused the attention on two of the most affected regions of northern italy lombardy and piedmont the authors based on pm10 daily exceedances and covid19 confirmed cases on march 12th thus before the italian sanitary crisis observed that pm10 concentration was exceeded only few times among the lombard cities that at the beginning of the epidemic were most affected on the contrary among some piedmont cities suffering of severe pm10 pollution events covid19 incidence was lower based on their results the authors concluded that covid19 diffusion by airborne pm10 is hard to demonstrate nevertheless several research  revealed how pm in particular pm25 could had a role in accelerate and vast diffusion of covid19 in northern italy for example coccia 2020b by analyzed data on  italian province capitals and data of infected individuals up to april 7th  revealed a relationship between air pollution of cities measured with days exceeding the limits set for pm10 in previous years and covid19 diffusion in particular cities with more than  days of pm10 exceedances showed a very high average number of infected individual about  infected individuals on 7th april  whereas cities having less than  days of pm10 exceedances showed a lower average number of infected about  infected individuals frontera    gave also evidences on the role of pm25 as a contributing

germany and correlated mortality with tropospheric no2  concentrations measured by the sentinel5 precursor spaceborne satellite the major tropospheric no2 hotspot identified was located in the northern italy in all european regions considered gas concentrations ranged between  and  Î¼molm2 with airflows directed downwards results showed that out of the  fatality cases by march     were in

evidences  collected  in  the  literature  highlight  the important  contribution  of  chronic  exposure  to  air  pollution  on  the covid19 spread and lethality although the potential effect of airborne virus exposure it has not been still demonstrated in particular it seems that pm25 and no2 are more closely correlated to covid19 than pm10 the lower correlation of pm10 with covid19 incidence and mortality can be due to the impossibility of particulate matter greater than  Î¼m to reach type ii alveolar cells where is located the cell entry receptor ace2 for sarscov2 nevertheless differences between countries such as the implementation of different lockdown restrictions stage of infection topographic sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics level of air pollution and meteorological factors may have contributed to obtain some contrasting finding although most of the revised studies support the relationship between air pollution and covid19 the manifold limitations of this review are the small number of papers collected and the great diversity of methodologies used sometimes lacking in some parts which makes the results difficult to compare the authors who first investigated this association although with great effort and rapidity of analysis dictated by a global emergency sometimes do not include all confounding factors whenever possible such as control policy urbanization rate availability of medical resources population size weather lifestyles sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables in addition to date incidence data are underestimated in all countries and to a lesser extent mortality data for this reason the cases included in the considered studies cannot be considered conclusive more studies are needed to better clarify the role of air pollution during the covid19 pandemic particularly studies that consider the multiplepollutants to strengthen scientific evidences and support firm conclusions useful to implement  pandemic  application  plans  to  adequately  prevent  new health emergencies for a long time we have known that reducing outdoor and indoor air pollution in cities or countries can have a significant effect on health almost immediately and the benefits can far outweigh the costs surely the health emergency that the world is experiencing right now highlights how environmental research is a fundamental

7536,Colon_Cancer,""" introduction  it  is  well  known  that  immune  system  is  highly  specific  to  protect  the  body against  various  environmental  pathogens  the  concept  of  conventional  vaccination  has overcome the pandemic situation of several infectious diseases outbreak area covered the recent idea of immunization through oral route edible vaccine is vital alternatives  over  conventional  vaccines  edible  vaccines  are  composed  of  antigenic  protein introduced  into  the  plant  cells  which  induce  these  altered  plants  to  produce  the  encoded protein  edible  vaccine  has  no  way  of  forming  infection  and  safety  is  assured  as  it  only composed  of  antigenic  protein  and  is  devoid  of  pathogenic  genes  edible  vaccines  have significant role in stimulating mucosal immunity as they come in contact with digestive tract lining they are safe costeffective easytoadminister and have reduced manufacturing cost   preproofhence have a dramatic impact on health care in developing countries  expert opinion the edible vaccine might be the solution for the potential hazard associated with  the  parenteral  vaccines  in  this  review  we  discuss  the  detailed  study  of  pros  cons mechanism  of  immune  stimulation  various  outbreaks  that  might  be  controlled  by  edible vaccines with the possible future research and applied application of edible vaccine keywords  edible  vaccine  outbreak  transformation  mucosal  immunity  adjuvants conventional vaccine probiotic       0c  preproof  introduction the  immune  system  is  a  dynamic  structure  in  our  body  that  protects  us  from  various pathogens immune system continuous tracking of molecules which circulate within the body to  detect  substances  which  negatively  affect  our  health  once  the  foreign  body  pathogens are  identified  the  immune  system  attacks  to  neutralize  them  with  the  help  of  antibodies1 human immune cells are extremely complex and quickly adjusted to overcome every days challenges literarily the immune system can be described as a complex collection of cells tissues ans and process working together to prevent disease the immune system targets microanism  like  a  virus  bacteria  pathogen  parasitic  worm  toxins  allergens  and  even sometimes own cell that show unusual characteristics as microanism rapidly evolves in a very  short  period  the  immune  system  has  to  be  prepared  to  handle  massive  diversity  of antigens which are commonly identified as an agent that activates immune system2 generally  each  molecule  may  be  an  antigen  but  researchers  have  found  that  carbohydrate and proteins offer the best response whereas lipids and nucleic acids are poor antigens the   preproofsensitivity  and  the  specificity  of  the  immune  system  should  be  taken  in  to  account  for  the developments  of  highly  specific  chemical  and  cellular  tools  as  it  is  known  that  immune system  is  complex  but  well  anized  as  a  result  this  destroys  or  kills  the  invading pathogens ensuring longterm protection against pathogens and immunological memory for the body that immediately reacts to subsequent encounters with the same antigen3sometimes body  immune  system  is  unable  to  combat  with  these  pathogens  or  microanisms  may  be due to the resistance causes in the microbe over the long period in which they modified their internal external structure modify receptors that present on their surface or due to the new strain  that  does  not  attack  before  to  the  human  body  to  overcome  this  problem  scientists develops vaccines usually contains whole microbe either killed or as a live form microbe small  parts  a  protein  molecule  or  toxins  that  mimic  the  diseasecausing  pathogen  these vaccine elements are used to activate the body's immune responses to identify kill or prevent further attacks of pathogens such as viruses bacteria fungi or other foreign bodies4 in both infectious and noninfectious disease vaccines play a crucial role to prevent it  nowadays  conventional  approaches  have  successfully  developed  a  vaccine  against many infectious diseases particularly by attenuating the pathogen inactivation of microbes or by  subunits  of  microbes  still  the  effectiveness  stability  cost  and  safety  of  these  current conventional vaccines remain important considerations in the production of vaccine delivery storage and availability of vaccine therefore it is important to create a new vaccine that is more costeffective and safer for the benefits of people relative to the current vaccine hence  0c  preproofa new alternative approach comes into the picture nowadays that is edible vaccine refer to the  use  of  edible  plantvegetable  parts  or  probiotics5  live  microanisms  as  a  vaccine which  is  taken  orally  as  whole  or  parts  of  plantvegetable  the  concept  of  edible  vaccine first given by charles arntzen in  as per the new research the probiotics and plant may be genetically modified with the help of gene transfer or transformation and plant virus that contains the human pathogen proteins for the development of an edible vaccine against various lifethreatening disease such as cholera chickenpox aids malaria foot and mouth disease fmd hepatitis b and c etc some of these diseases require booster vaccination or multiple  antigens  to  promote  and  retain  protective  immunity  the  plants  can  express  more than  one  transgene  which  allows  delivery  of  multiple  antigens  for  repeated  inoculation8 mostly the oral vaccine is associated with degradation of proteins in the stomach due to the action of the gastric enzyme and low ph and gut which restricts immune response but due to the rigid protective plant cell wall these proteins get protection from the stomach acids and enzymes as human enzymes are incapable of breaking down  glycosidic bonds of plant cell wall carbohydrates9but  subsequently release proteins at the gut lumen due to the action of microbial enzymes which break the plant cell wall bioencapsulation lactobacillus species   preproofare  considered  intrinsically  resistant  to  acid  and  the  survival  rate  of  probiotic  lactobacilli increased  in  acidic  condition  when  given  with  glucose10the resistant of  probiotic  and  by encapsulation  of antigensin  plants  stomach  acid  or  at  low  ph  will  provide  extra  future prospects  and  tools  to  over  come  the  challenges  that  will  be  faced  by  edible  vaccines regarding its degradation in the stomach due to gastric enzyme now fda has approved plant cells  for  costeffective  production  of  protein  drugs  pds  in  large  scale  current  good manufacturing  practice  cgmp  hydroponic  growth  facilities11  in  freezedry  lyophilized plant  cells  proteindrugs  pds  are  more  stable  at  ambient  temperature  for  a  longer  period and maintain their folding and efficacy11   outbreak of diseases an outbreak occurs when several cases of a particular disease increase more than expected in a  specific  region  over  a  specific  period  in  the  last  three  decades  numbers  of  highly transmissible or pathogenic infectious disease like zika ebola monkeypox sars measles polio cholera diphtheria cases have increased in many parts of the globe12 this trend further continues  with  zoonotic  spillover  events  expected  to  continue  as  a  result  of  population expansion  or  overcrowding  of  cities  unhygienic  condition  pollution  and  migration  to uninhabited areas and effect of global warming on vector distribution due to the presence of these  factors  it  decreases  the  ability  of  the  individual  to  combat  these  diseases  in  recent  0c  preproofyear's  demand  for  pharmaceutical  products  vaccine  increase  over  the  world  to  treat  these diseases  however  some  counties  are  unable  to  manufacture  these  vaccines  due  to  poor infrastructure  or  buy  these  vaccines  at  higher  prices  in  these  countries  the  edible  vaccine may be a better option to combat diseases as edible vaccines are cheap and stable for a longer time table    criteria  for  the  selection  of  plant  or  plant  part  for  the  development  of  an  edible vaccine edible vaccines are the form of medication taken as food by the humans and animals to boost their  immunity  thus  the  criteria  needed  in  selecting  plants  for  the  production  of  edible vaccine must meet specific requirements the far most important criteria of selecting plant is its  life  cycle13  it  shouldnt  be  longer  as  if  it  takes  long  time  for  maturation  then  their production and maintenance cost increase the next criteria are the choice of plant for antigen incorporation  which  should  not  contain  any  biomolecule  that  will  interact  with  it  next many  plants  have  been identified  and  studied for the  edible  vaccine  which was  transformed to  express  antigen  for  rotavirus  gastroenteritis  cholera  autoimmune  diseases  and  rabies moreover several experiments have used vegetable potato but potatoes may not be the ideal choice  for  edible  vaccines  since  frying  or  boiling  will  degrade  certain  antigenic  proteins certain  foods  such  as  bananas  tomato  carrots  peanuts  corn  and  tobacco  have  a  more promising  potential  as  edible  vaccines  as  it  can  be  eaten  raw  not  only  because  they  are commonly  available  but  since  genetic  engineering  is  efficiently  developed  these  kinds  of vegetable  plants  the  following  plant  list  contains  edible  vaccines  previously  studied  in animals and which are required to be approved in both human and animal use  potato   preproofimportant one is the stability of the antigen under high temperature as all vegetable or plant parts  are  not  eaten  raw  eg  potato  rice  pea  sometime  they  are  boiled  or  fried  at  higher temperature  plant  and  plant  parts  that  can  be  consumed  raw  are  preferable  for  human immunization  however  banana  might  be  the  ideal  source  of  edible  vaccines  because  they are consumed raw  even  by infants  and are a major crop in  many developing counties8 the one  disadvantage  of  both  banana  and  tomato  is  the  low  protein  content  of  the  fruit  which might limit the amount of antigen that can be expressed13 in contrast seeds of the plants such as  maize  and  soybean  have  higher  protein  content  and  have  been  reported  to  express  very high level of foreign proteins  edible vaccine from the plant source  0c  preproofmason et al was the first person who conducts the vaccinebased assay produced in potato solanum tuberosum to fight against ltb stain produced by e coli in mice14 in that same year  in  rats

the  norwalk  virus  capsid  pathogen  was  identified  in  rats  and  human volunteers1215thanavalas'group  proposed  in    that  potatoes  could  play  a  role  in  human hepatitis  b  as  an  oral  reinforcement  since  injectable  vaccine  cause  redness  swelling  or itching  at  the  site  of  administration  also  the  edible  vaccine  for  the  animal  has  now  been developed to replace the injectable vaccine for animal protection12  tomatotobacco model species for the edible vaccine1  cherry tomatillos tomato  solanum  lycopersicum  an  appropriate  candidate  for  vaccine

has been used as a tool to achieve a large number of proteins specific to both animal and humans for therapeutic purpose1819the use of algae for the production of vaccines is optimistic as algae have a very high growth rate the entire system  can  be  used  as  a  raw  material  for  the  development  of  edible  vaccines  besides  to facilitate  the  already  rapidly  growing  algae  can  be  cultivated  in  bioreactors  c  reinhardtii contains one chloroplast which facilitates the stability of the desired antigens in the algal line notably  the  effectiveness  of  algal  vaccines  after  lyophilization  is  unchanged  which  might based  on  the  expression  of  the  capsid  protein  norwalk  virus  the  transgenic  plant  was developed protein  deposition  in  the unripened  fruit

vaccine was denied21  papaya in  a papaya carica papaya vaccine was developed to counter cysticercosis caused by taenia solium by expressing synthetic peptides in  transgenic papaya clones vaccine was tested  in  rats  with  an  immunogenic  response  of    per  cent  in  vaccinated  animals  these  0c  preproofedible vaccines may offer  good relief both  in  humans and in  pigs which are the two major carriers of the disease22  carrot in an experiment carrot along with a thaliana was utilized to develop an edible vaccine for surface  hiv  antigen  expression  and  in  the  study  it  was  reported  that  rats  showed  more positive  effect  compared  to  those  nontreated  animals25  carrot  daucus  carota  has  a positive effect in the treatment of hiv not only because carrots are nutritious and tasty but because  of  carrot  main  chemical  constituent  carotenoids  which  on  consumption  by  rats increases monocytes  lymphocytes  and  other  immune  defence  thus  people  with  a weakened  immune  system  might  benefit  from  the  use  of  this  potential  edible  antihiv vaccine26 the efficacy of this antihiv vaccine must be confirmed by a clinical trial in  it  has  been  reported  that  the  ureb  subunit  of  helicobacter  pylori  was  used  in  transgenic carrots  as  a  potential  vaccine  transgenic  carrot  expressing  the  b  subunit  from  e  coli

antigen genes from a pathogenic anism bacteria viruses or parasites that have already been identified and for which antibodies are easily accessible can be controlled in a twofold fashion in one scenario the whole structural gene is inserted inside  the  functional  elements  of  the  '  to  '  plant  transformation  vector  allowing  the transcription and aggregation of the coding sequence in the plant32 for the second scenario the  epitope  is  identified  within  the  antigen  dna  fragment  encoding  may  be  used  to  create genes through fusion with coated protein gene with the plant virus eg cmv or tmv then the recombinant virus is then introduced into suitable healthy plants which produce several new plants  0c  preprooftable    method for the transformation of genedna into selected plants essentially  there  are  two  types  of  plant  transformation  methods  but  many  other  approaches have also been utilized to transformation  vectorplasmid  carrier  system  agrobacterium tumefacien  mediated  gene transfer agrobacterium a soil bacterium naturally occurring has been used to transfer a small fragment  of  dna  into  the  plant  genome  and  is  called  transformation5051  in  this method  the  appropriate  recombinant  dna  is  inserted  into  the  tregion  of  disarmed tiplasmid  of  agrobacterium  tumefaciens  plant  pathogens  which  is  cocultured with  the  plant  cells  andor  the  tissue  that  will  be  transformed  the  insertion  of  the exogenous  genes  and  the  infection  of  such  a  plant  tissue  into  sufficiently  modified agrobacterium tdna cell contributed to studies of the stable gene incorporation in the  genome  of  the  plant  as  well  as  transgenic  protein  production32  however  this technique is sluggish and yield are lower but the application of this transformation is first  limited  to  tobacco  plant  and  too  few  other  plant  species  which  extend  to  most   preproofvegetable species including leguminose and graminae  microprojectile bombardment biolistic method this  is  a  sophisticated  method  based  on  the  microprojectile  bombardment  the selected  dna  sequence  is  precipitated  on  microparticles  of  metals  eg  tungsten gold and  bombarded  by  a  particle  gun  at  an  accelerated  rate  toward  selected  plant tissue5253  these  metallic  microparticles  penetrate  the  cell walls  and  the  exogenous dna is emitted into the cell where it is integrated into the nuclear genome through a process  known  for  the  photosynthetic  role  of  cytoplasmic  anelles  called chloroplast  comprising  chlorophyll  particle  gun  shoots  adequately  charged  metallic particles  with  selected  and  processed  dna  which  penetrate  chloroplast  and  merge with  its  genome32  transformation  of  the  chloroplast  is  an  effective  alternative  to nuclear transformation5455  pds in chloroplast are more stable when plant cells lyophilized and when preserved at ambient temperature  therefore the freezedrying  method improves  pds concentration and prevents bacterial contamination11  electroporation  in this method dna is introduced into the cells to which the electrical pulses of high voltage  are  released  which  are  intended  to  create  transitory  pores  in  the  0c  preproofplasmalemma  it  requires  the  extra  effort  to  weaken  the  cell  wall  as  it  serves  as  an efficient barrier to the entrance of dna into the cell cytoplasm32   mechanisms  of  action  of  edible  vaccines  for  mucosal  and  peripheral  immune figure

including proteolytic enzymes acidic ph bile  salts  and  limited  permeability  that  may  hinder  the  induction  of  a  protective  immune response20  mucosal  immunity  system  described  above  have  a  clear  image  that  induction  of  mucosal immune response starts with the recognition of an antigen by specialized cells called mcells located  in  the  mucosal  membranes  of  lymphoid  tissues  such  as  peyers  patches  within  the small  intestine57  then  the  apc  internalize  and  process  the  antigen  as  soon  mcell  channel antigens  into  the  underlying  tissues  causing

7538,Colon_Cancer,continuously increasing with development of the economy and the environment [] the prognosis for hcc patients remains extremely poor although significant progress has been achieved strategies for early diagnosis are urgently needed because the majority of patients with hcc are diagnosed in very late stages however the molecular mechanism of hcc has not been clearly defined circular rnas circrnas are a new class of rna molecules that have functions as regulators of parental gene transcription in alternative splicing and as mirna sponges   through use of rna deep sequencing gtechnology numerous circrnas have been identified as the predominant regulatory elements in diseases   moreover accumulating evidence shows that circrnas play pivotal roles in many diseases in particular abnormally expressed circrnas are involved in tumor progression including cell proliferation migration and invasion [] in addition some research indicates that circrnas level are closely correlated wit specific phenotypes and tumorigenesis in hcc [] nevertheless the research concerning circrnas is frankly in its infancy which greatly hinders the application of circrnas as biomarkers for diagnosis of hcc in clinicsrelated research shows that circrnas possess great potential to be used for diagnosis of hcc   recent studies have found that hsa_circ_0067934 plays oncogenic roles by accelerating cell proliferation and metastasis in glioblastoma gbm   circsmarca5 was significantly elevated and thereby suppressed cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in prostate cancer   in addition previous studies have shown that downregulation of hsa_circ_0005986 facilitated cell proliferation by promoting the g0g1 to s phase transition in hcc   similarly alteration in expression of circrnas correlated with development and metastasis of malignant tumors   these data suggest that circrnas may be of greater benefit in clinical diagnosis of hcc however reliable circrna biomarkers for hcc are still lacking therefore this review synthetically integrates available data on the role of circrna in hcc progression and attempts to provide crucial clues for investigating the molecular mechanism regarding hccoverview of circrnacircrnas are a category of singlestranded closedcircle molecules which take part in multifaceted biological regulation   recently research has verified that the majority of circrnas are synthesized by backspliced exons and that others are formed from intron intergenic and untranslated regions utr therefore biogenesis of circrnas can be divided into eicirnas exonintron circrnas ecircrnas circular exonic rnas and cirnas circular intronic rnas   meanwhile over  circrnas have been identified   and this type of transcript has been considered a new form of gene expression   generally the structure of the transcription is inverted and the order of genomic exons is altered and these exons are spliced over time the biological functions of circrnas

great attention related to their pathological role in disease development compared with linear rnas circrnas have special properties including biological roles and clinical use circrnas are mainly enriched in certain body fluids comprising blood saliva and urine   they are covalently closed loop structures   degradation of most rna is highly dependent on rna exonuclease or rnase hence circrnas remain highly stable based on their high resistance to enzyme degradation   moreover studies have shown that expression of circrnas is tissuespecific and correlated with different phases of development   and they exhibit different expression patterns at different developmental stages  roles of circrnasaccumulating evidence shows that circrnas play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diseases as a result of their complex biological functions generally the molecular functions of circrnas mainly include being sponges of mirna acting as rnabinding proteins performing alternative splicing of premrnas regulating transcription and translation and potentially encoding proteins these properties are described in detail belowsponges of mirnathe different types of circrnas have different mirna binding sites some circrnas negatively regulate mirnas by absorbing and specifically binding to mirnas then decreasing mirna activity and elevating expression of mirnarelated target genes   researchers have shown that cirs7 inhibits mir7 function and positively mediates mir7 target genes acting as a molecular sponge   in addition functional analyses have indicated that circrnas constitute an entire molecular regulatory network which specifically regulates degradation of mirnas as mirna sponges  this work is licensed under creative common attributionnoncommercialnoderivatives

effect of circrnas in initiation and progression of tumors has not been fully clarified   to date related studies have revealed that certain circrnas are highly expressed in tumor tissues and overexpression of circrnas promotes tumor proliferation and deterioration an investigation revealed that hsa_circ_002059 was downregulated in gastric cancer   while hsa_circ_0004018 was upregulated in

hbv   or hcv   in addition alcohol abuse is a crucial factor for onset of hcc [] obesity hypertension and diabetes are closely linked with development of hcc but specific correlations remain unknown   moreover regular screening has been widely applied for early detection and to ensure effective treatment of hcc most commonly good results have been achieved with regular screening with ultrasonography blood alphafetoprotein content testing mri and ct  generally surgical resection and chemotherapy are mainstays of therapy in patients with hcc yet some tumors cannot be fully removed

intracellular andextracellular matrices in diï¬erent ways of secretion [ ]cthrc1 increases the activity of collagen promoter throughbinding to ligands and could contribute to vascular remodeling by limiting collagen matrix deposition and promoting cellmigration   cthrc1 promotes the recruitment of m2macrophages and regulates tgf and notch pathways toaccelerate wound healing in a mouse model of

 cthrc1 can activate tgf signaling via an elevationin smad2smad3 phosphorylation activated smad23 formsa complex with smad4 and accumulates in the nucleus causing an increase in collagen type i

cthrc1 is induced by tgf1 via phosphosmad3 binding to the promoter with subsequenttranscription activation and in turn cthrc1inhibits tgf1 signaling by accelerating proteasomal degradation of phosphosmad3 which inhibits collagen deposition tgf can enhance the migration and invasioncharacteristics of endothelial cells by regulating the secretionand expression of mmp2 and mmp9   therefore inhibiting cthrc1mediated tgf signaling pathways mayeï¬ectively suppress the invasion and angiogenesis of cancercells [ ]however the mechanism of tgf involved in tumorprogression is very complex even

enterococcus faecium vrefm is a significant health careassociated pathogen vrefm infections can be difï¬cult to treat due to their intrinsicand acquired resistance to nearly all classes of antibiotics  the world healthanization categorizes vrefm as a high priority bacterial pathogen advocatingresearch to stop the global increase in antibiotic resistance  recent studies highlightthe importance of the gut microbiota in modulating the growth and virulence of vrefmin the gastrointestinal ecosystem for instance the depletion of normal gut ï¬ora usingantibiotics exacerbates the severity of vrefm infection  whereas transplant ofcommensal species including a consortium of clostridium bolteae blautia productablautia sartorii and parabacteroides distasonis   can drive established vrefm colonization to below levels of culture detection speciï¬cally b productaa colonizer ofthe colonreduces vrefm growth in vivo by secreting a lantibiotic  these observations raise the intriguing possibility that metabolic traits act in concert betweenpathogen and select gut commensals to confer mutual beneï¬ts during pathogenpersistence these ï¬ndings also highlight the greater risk posed to immunocompromised patients when colonized with vrefm for instance allogeneic hematopoietic celltransplantation patients have gastrointestinal tracts that are dominated by vrefm as aresult of losing a large portion of the intestinal commensal microbiota upon receivingbroadspectrum antibiotics as pretreatment  hildebrand   discovered longtermecological impacts to the gut microbiome with strong bacterial species turnover afterceftriaxone treatment in humans  further mice receiving broadspectrum antibioticscombination of metronidazole neomycin and vancomycin showed markedly increased vrefm colonization of the cecum and colon the compromised intestinal innateimmune defenses in these animals allowed proliferation of vrefm caused by theantibiotic exposure and subsequently reduced the expression of antimicrobial molecules produced by bacteria in the intestinal mucosa the problem with vrefm is further complicated by the fact that enterococci aremembers of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota a key reservoir of antimicrobialresistance amr genes and potentially facilitating gene transfer within the gut microbiome  for example the vanb resistance gene was detected in human fecalspecimens that did not contain culturable vre and instead demonstrated that isolatescarrying the resistance transposon are anaerobic commensal bacteria eggerthella lentaand clostridium innocuum  colonization of and persistence in the gastrointestinaltract therefore presents as a key mechanism for de novo vre and may lead to severeinvasive diseasethe current study aimed

adenocarcinoma  it has been reported that individuals with ibd may have an increased risk of developing crc which is directly proportional to the extent and duration of their disease  however the exact mechanism and duration required for chronic colitis to develop into adenoma and then adenocarcinoma remains unclear  it has been suggested that patients with ibd have an increased risk of crc following the inflammationdysplasiacarcinoma model  including dysplasia and crc as primary consequences of chronic inflammation however there are currently still no defined molecular biomarkers or existing monitoring protocols for detecting the occurrence of a malignant tumor except for frequent colonoscopy examinationsin  the  present  study  an  acute  colitischronic colitisadenomaadenocarcinoma model was successfully constructed via aomdss induction using this model tlr9 expression levels were discovered to be upregulated as the severity of the colorectal lesions increased which indicated that tlr9 protein expression levels may be continuously activated during colitiscrc development tlr9 is a critical protein associated with innate and acquired immunity  and it has been demonstrated to serve a significant role in the development of colitis  and sporadic crc  however the mechanism by which tlr9 regulates the development of crc remains to be elucidatedinterestingly ihc analysis revealed that the expression levels of nfÎºb and ki67 were simultaneously upregulated alongside tlr9 expression levels notably inhibiting tlr9 decreased the migration proliferation and viability of ht29 cells in vitro and tlr9 expression levels in vivo were identified to be significantly positively correlated with the expression levels of nfÎºb and ki67 a cell proliferation marker during the transition from colitis to crc the present study further revealed that the inhibition of tlr9 in vitro significantly downregulated the expression levels of nfÎºb myd88 pcna and the antiapoptotic protein bclxl in a dose and timedependent manner notably a previous study reported that tlr9 promoted the tumorpropagating potential of prostate cancer cells via nfÎºb signaling  thus the findings of the present study indicated that tlr9 may promote cac through nfÎºb signaling however these findings may be controversial because other previous studies have revealed that tlr9 agonists exerted an antitumor effect in crc  the majority of these studies primarily focused on the role of tlr9 in colitis or sporadic crc whereas the current study focused on the role of tlr9 in the pathogenesis of cac to provide novel targets for the treatment of cac for example alterations in microtubule endbinding protein  were identified as a characteristic of sporadic but not ucassociated crc  and in another previous study the immune profiling patterns of patients with cac were significantly different compared with the patients with sporadic crc chloroquine a nonspecific inhibitor of tlr9 is an old antimalarial drug  which has recently attracted significant interest for its potential antitumor properties for example numerous studies have reported that chloroquine directly regulated cancer cells by inducing apoptosis inhibiting autophagy interacting with nucleotides eliminating cancer stem cells and enhancing the growth of cancer cells  chloroquine also inhibited the expression levels of tlr9 by preventing the acidification and maturation of the endosomes and the trafficking of tlrs  due to the multiple effects of chloroquine on tumor cells different concentrations of chloroquine were selected for use in the present study based on the lowest dose according to previous studies  in order to obtain the best possible results with low toxicity to the cells in the future investigations using small interfering rna targeting tlr9 should be performed to determine the effect on the biological processes of crc cell lines to further verify the findings of the present study thus our future studies will focus on investigating the precise molecular mechanism by which tlr9 participates in the early occurrence of colorectal carcinogenesisin  the present study developed a cac animal model the findings indicated that tlr9 may be closely associated with the process of inflammationdysplasiacarcinoma and may impact carcinogenesis by regulating the nfÎºb signaling pathway these results may provide promising potential to be developed into an early detection protocol or therapeutic molecular target for

7542,Colon_Cancer,""" drug resistance leads to tumor relapse and further progression  during  chemotherapy  in  lung  cancer  close homolog of l1 chl1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in most malignancies however to the best of our knowledge whether chl1 mediates chemoresistance remains unknown the present study observed that chl1 was significantly downregulated in cisplatin ddpresistant cells a549ddp and paclitaxel ptxresistant cells a549ptx compared with a549 cells when treated with or without ddp and ptx silencing of chl1 in a549 cells promoted the cell survival rate and clone formation and decreased apoptosis whereas overexpression of chl1 in a549ddp and a549ptx cells impeded the cell survival and clone formation and promoted apoptosis additionally chl1 overexpression enhanced the chemosensitivity of a549ddp cells to ddp in vivo notably the chemoresistance induced by chl1 depletion was reversed by the akt inhibitor sc66 in a549 cells the results of the present study demonstrated that chl1 enhanced sensitivity of lung cancer cells by suppressing the akt pathway which suggested that chl1 may be a potential target for overcoming chemoresistance in lung

effects by inducing dna damage and hindering dna damage repair  paclitaxel ptx another commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the clinic targets the microtubule cytoskeleton and impedes cell division  the majority of patients have a good initial response to chemotherapy agents however subsequent relapse is common and largely due to the emergence of drug resistance  thus chemoresistance is considered one of the main factors of poor prognosis in patients with advanced nsclc  therefore there is an urgent need to investigate the target and mechanism of chemoresistance in nsclcclose homolog of l1 chl1 is a member of the l1 family of nerve cell adhesion molecules and is located on the 3q26 locus  as a nerve cell adhesion molecule chl1 serves an important role in the development regeneration and plasticity of the nervous system  the absence or mutation of chl1 can trigger 3p syndrome and schizophrenia  the abnormal expression of chl1 may lead to reduced working memory and

7543,Colon_Cancer,""" colorectal cancer crc is the third leading cause of cancerassociated mortality the present study aimed to investigate novel biomarkers to predict prognosis and provide a theoretical basis for studies of the pathogenesis and the development of therapies for crc the present study compared mrna expression levels of patients with crc with short and longterm prognosis and of individuals with and without tumors in the cancer genome atlas tcga database differentially expressed genes degs were identified via volcano plot and venn diagram analysis gene ontology go analysis and gene set enrichment analysis gsea were performed to identify the functions of the degs and the degs were further verified using clinical crc samples a total of  degs were identified as candidate genes using the tcga database and four degs [defensin  4a defb4a hyaluronan binding protein  habp2 oleoylacp hydrolase and tbc1 domain family member 3g] were associated with poor prognosis of patients with crc two degs defb4a and habp2 were upregulated in tumor tissues of patients with crc in the tcga database go and gsea analyses revealed that defb4a was highly associated with immunosuppression participates in myeloid leukocyte differentiation leukocyte proliferation and positive regulation of leukocytemediated immunity and was positively correlated with cd11b cd14 cd45 cd163 and il17a furthermore defb4a expression was significantly upregulated in patients with large tumors advanced cancer stage lymph node metastasis and liver metastasis survival analysis revealed that defb4a upregulation was associated with poor prognosis defb4a correspondence to dr yi zhang biotherapy center the first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university  jianshe east road

crcintroductionaccording to the global cancer statistic of  colorectal cancer crc is the third most common  cancer and the second leading cause of cancerassociated mortality  worldwide  crc was reported as the fourth most common and fatal cancer in china in   patients with crc usually have a low survival rate and poor therapeutic responses and are susceptible to progression and recurrence  early diagnosis and effective treatment are critical to improve the survival of patients with crc  crc studies have focused on innovative ideas to identify molecular markers used to develop highprecision noninvasive screening tests for crc to increase population compliance and reduce the potentially harmful side effects associated with more invasive techniques  diagnostic markers will give an indication of the likely progression of the disease  targeting specific molecules in certain patients has facilitated more personalized treatments that help prevent or decelerate cancer progression the present study aimed to determine prognostic factors and novel therapeutic targets to improve the survival of patients with crcprevious  studies  have  focused  on  the  identification of molecules associated with tumor progression through genetic or mrna profiling and screening of patients with colon cancer  for example the expression profiles of long noncoding rnas lncrnas were compared at specific tumor stages t0 t1 t2 and t3 in an azoxymethanedextran sodium sulfateinduced primary colon cancer model and upregulation of the lncrna h19 predicted a poor prognosis  other studies analyzed microrna mir expression profiles between tumor tissues and matched nontumor tissues obtained from patients with crc for example mir is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues and associated with poor survival of patients with crc and may thus be considered to be a poor prognostic marker of crc  furthermore high expression levels of mir  0cwu    prognostic role of defb4a in colorectal cancerand mir in serum are associated with poor survival of patients with crc  analysis of the cancer genome atlas tcga database revealed that mmp19 is upregulated in patients with crc and is associated with tumor progression  however to the best of our knowledge no study has directly screened mrna profiles based on prognosis the present study divided patients with crc into different groups based on prognosis and screened the mrna profiles of the respective groups defensin  4a defb4a also known as bd sap1 defb2 defb4 hbd defb and defb102 belongs to the defensin family comprising cytotoxic peptides secreted by neutrophils which serve important roles in innate immune defense against microbial infections   defb4a is upregulated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma  it serves an important role in esophageal carcinogenesis both in vivo and in vitro  the genomic copy number of defb4a has been analyzed in  patients with  crohn's  disease  and    controls  and  an  elevated defb4a copy number has been identified as a risk factor for crohn's disease regardless of disease origin  however it remains unclear whether defb4a expression is associated with the prognosis of crc furthermore the role of defb4a in the immune system remains unclear the tumor microenvironment serves a significant role in tumor progression various immune elements comprise the tumor microenvironment including bone marrowderived cells such as macrophages cd4 t cells cd8 t cells b cells natural killer cells and dendritic cells  myeloid cells can differentiate into macrophages or myeloidderived suppressor cells mdscs which serve a tumorigenic role in the tumor microenvironment  mdscs contribute to tumor vascular development by promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth  tumorassociated macrophages tams are important regulators of tumorigenesis by inhibiting the antitumor effects of other cells thus promoting tumor growth  however it remains unclear whether defb4a has a regulatory effect on the tumor microenvironment or whether it promotes crc progressionto identify candidate target genes that potentially prolong patient survival mrna expression profiles of tissues from crc samples were compared in the tcga database venn analysis was performed to determine candidate genes upregulated in tumor tissues among patients with poor prognosis subsequently immuneassociated pathway enrichment was analyzed using gene ontology go and gene set enrichment analysis gsea and the correlations between candidate target genes and certain

antimicrobial peptides defb4a and camp are inhibited by hsamir leading to suppression of the tlr21induced vitamin d antimicrobial signaling pathway   defb4a has been suggested as a biomarker for psoriasis because the clinical efficacy of targeted antibody therapy in psoriasis is associated with the inhibition of defb4a expression  defb4a expression can directly be inhibited by anthralin in

myeloid leukocyte differentiation leukocyte proliferation and positive regulation of leukocytemediated immunity therefore defb4a may be associated with immunity in crc to the best of our knowledge the present study was the first to report defb4a as a prognostic marker for crc and as an immunoregulatory factor in the tumor microenvironment in patients with crc however a limitation of the present study was that the research cohort was not large enough which may affect the statistical results in addition the specific role of defb4a and immune factors in colon cancer and the underlying molecular mechanism need to be further exploredin conclusion to the best of our knowledge defb4a is upregulated in patients with crc and is closely associated with poor prognosis defb4a regulates immune function and potentially promotes immunosuppression therefore defb4a may be considered as a prognostic marker and immunotherapeutic target for crcacknowledgementsnot

more recentlyin  a new human coronavirus designated as middle eastrespiratory syndromecoronavirus merscov was identiï¬ed and the global ongoing outbreak of mers with over oï¬cial cases and  deaths represented approximately case fatality rate to date in humans  over the last few months a new strain of human coronavirus sarscov2 also known as 2019ncov hascaught the worlds seven continents attention with its rapidglobal spread aï¬ecting at least  countries and territoriesinfecting more than  and claiming more than lives worldwide   the coronavirus pandemichas promoted isolation and

similaritiesamong diï¬erent coronavirus species but not in all aspects 0coxidative medicine and cellular longevitydepending on the molecular mechanism of viral inhibitionpromoted by an antiviral agent the analysis of the data andcomparison between animal and human covs must be donevery carefully in fact it is important to note that there arediï¬erences between human and animal cov receptorswhich will likely result in diï¬erent aï¬nities or unlikely interactions of an antiviral agent with the diï¬erent cov receptors howeverif the antiviral agent interferes with thereplication andor assembly of the covs there is a higherprobability of obtaining similar antiviral activity results inhuman cov tests [   ] following this line our searchin specialized literature was focused mainly on studies thatinvestigated the anticoronavirus eï¬ects of natural antioxidants by inhibiting proteases for viral replication materials and methodsthe present study was carried out based on a search of the literature of natural antioxidants and coronavirus the searchperformed in the pubmed database included studies published until march  and used the following keywordscoronavirusstressmerscov sarscov

oxidative pathogenic mechanism of coronavirusinduced cell damagethe high mortality rate associated with the three pathogenichcovs has been mainly attributed to the development ofdigestive and

macrophage ltrationare sometimes accompanied by watery diarrhoea dehydration and vomiting [  ]despite the molecular mechanisms of coronavirusinduced intestine and lung pathogenesis not fully elucidatedand still unclear studies have suggested that lateterm diseaseprogression is unrelated to viremia it is now believed morelikely to be associated with the immunopathological mechanism [ ] viral clearance and subsequent recovery frominfection require activation of an eï¬ective host immuneresponse however many immune eï¬ector cells may alsocause injury to host tissues   together with ammatoryand immune response signaling the presence of oxidativecompounds such as reactive oxygen species ros playsimportant roles in the pathogenic mechanism of cell damageinduced by covs through oxidative stress  oxidative stress is deï¬ned as an interruption andorderegulation of the signaling and redox system that can becaused by an imbalance in the production of oxidant andantioxidant species   among the main oxidant agentsros and reactive nitrogen species rns stand out in orderto counterbalance the oxidant species there is an antioxidantsystem formed by enzymes and nonenzymatic molecules   however during pathological events such as viral infections there may be an increase in the production of oxidantspecies not neutralized by the antioxidant system resultingin oxidative stress that promotes cellular damage throughprotein denaturation changes in the functions of nucleicacids lipid peroxidation and cell death []in addition during viral infection oxidative stress contributes to viral pathogenesis through stimulating ammation loss of immune function and increased viral replicationthat may occur due to the activation of the nuclear factorkappa b nfÎºb transcription pathway [] currentevidence suggests that cytokine dysregulationalso calledcytokine stormcontributes to severe disease caused by thepathogenic covs [ ] the exact mechanisms are notclear yet but research on uenza a virus shows that infection causes a rapid ux of ammatory cells this isfollowed by an increase in reactive oxygen species productionand cytokine expression and release which ultimately leadsto acute lung injury   in general rna viruses promotechanges in the bodys antioxidant defense system aï¬ectingenzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod and catalasecat in addition to reducing the levels of antioxidantmolecules such as ascorbic acid carotenoids and reducedglutathione gsh [] wu   reported that glucose6phosphate dehydrogenasean important antioxidantenzyme that produces nadph knockdown cells were moresusceptible to infection by hcov229e than normal cells  interestingly ye and colleagues have reported that theinhibition of ros production alleviates ammation causedby uenza a virus infections  in an experimental model of sarsinduced acute lunginjury in mice it was noted that phospholipid oxidationdue to oxidative stress is one of the main triggering factorsof acute lung injury this happens through the activation ofthe innate immune response culminating in the activationof pulmonary macrophages via tlr4triftraf6nfÎºbsignaling   furthermore hypoxia caused by acute lunginjury can cause myocardial injury due to the production ofros aggravating infections caused by coronavirus disease covid19  mitochondria have an essential function in energy generation and for this reason their function and integrity arestrictly regulated in order to respond to varying energyrequirements and environmental conditions   mitochondria are known to function as the control point in apoptoticpathways releasing proapoptotic factors mainly ros whichfunction as a signaling molecule that may result in cell death[ ] some studies have shown a relationship betweencoronavirus infection and dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria leading to the release of ros and other proapoptotic substances [ ] in a recent study xu   reportedthat ros and p53 play key roles in regulating many kindsof the cell process during coronavirus infection in vero cellsaccording to the authors coronavirus infection appears toinduce a timedependent ros accumulation which in turnis linked to regulatory mechanisms of p53 activation andapoptosis in infected cells  antioxidant substances promote improvement in casesof disease caused by coronaviruses such as apolipoproteinda lipocalin that promoted a neuroprotective eï¬ect against 0coxidative medicine and cellular longevityencephalitis induced by human coronavirus oc43in micethis protective eï¬ect occurred through the reduction of oxidative stress cerebral lipid peroxidation and regulation ofammation [ ] also the treatment with antioxidantssuch as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or nacetylcysteine significantly inhibits moreover melatonin promotes downregulation of acute lungoxidative injury due to its antiammatory and antioxidantactions making it a possible compound in the treatment ofcovid19   based on these studies compounds thathave antioxidant actions can be helpful in the treatment ofinfections promoted by coronaviruscoronavirusinduced apoptosisin general antioxidant properties of polyphenolic compounds such as some ï¬avonoids have been associated withthe presence of aromatic phenolic rings that promote theelectron donation and hydrogen atom transfer

oral bioavailability of egcg is not so profound inhealthy humans as it was only  of the total ingestion  most of the ingested egcg is absorbed in the smallintestine and substantially degraded in the

defense enzymes such as catalase cat andsuperoxide dismutase sod could minimize h2o2 levelwhich is essential to maintain the redox balancethe concentration of egcg in the cell environmentseems to be a

anticancer action the anticancer mechanismsvaried depending on the cell type dose andor time oftreatment table  []apoptosis is the bestdescribed form of programmed celldeath the induction of apoptosis represents a universal andideal therapeutic strategy for cancer control cell apoptosiscould be triggered by either the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway or the external death receptor pathway   the mitochondrial pathway could be induced by intracellularstresses such as oxidative stressthe apoptosistriggering eï¬ects of ros have beennoted in vitro table  egcg inhibited cell growth ina dosedependent manner and the decrease in the numberof viable cells was mainly due to apoptosis caused by theegcginduced intracellular ros as early as the last century scientists found that egcg induced h2o2 formationin human lung cancer celllines h661 and 21bes andexogenously added cat completely prevented egcginduced cell apoptosis which suggested that h2o2 isinvolved in the apoptosis process provoked by egcg  similar actions were also found in various cancersand tumor cells table  thioredoxin trx and thioredoxin reductase trxr are pivotal regulators of cellularredox homeostasis decreased trxtrxr activity mightcontribute to the increased ros level high concentrationof egcg inactivated trxtrxr via the formation of egcgtrx1 and egcgtrxr conjugates which was linked to theelevation of ros level in hela cells and further promotedcancer cell death   moreover one of the biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis is genomic dna fragmentation chen  performed the dna fragmentation assay in theskov3 cells indicating that egcg induced apoptosis bycausing dna damage   this result was consistent withother studies in ovarian and cervical cancer cells [ ]in terms of

cells [ ] together these results suggest thategcginduced apoptosis is mediated through ros generation and might subsequently activate the cell intrinsic pathway  in the presence of transition metals such as copper andiron h2o2 could convert to a potent oxidant hydroxyl radical via the fenton reaction nakagawa   found that egcg Î¼m produced h2o2 and triggered fenton reactionto form highly toxic

cellulardna damage egcg could inhibit cell proliferation andinduce apoptosis through cellular dna breakage in diï¬erentcancer cell lines   such dna breakage involved the mobilization of endogenous copper ions and the generation ofros moreover the observation of site speciï¬city of dnadamage by egcg is valuable cuiimediated dna damageby egcg occurred most frequently at t and g residues  egcg was able to mobilize endogenous copper ions andgenerate hydroxyl radicals in situ   hydroxyl radicalsserved as the proximal dna cleaving agentleading todna breakage in the nuclei this result was possibly due tothe interaction of egcg with chromatinbound copper ionsand then the nondiï¬usible hydroxyl radicals were formed atthe binding site hence hydroxyl radical generated nearbydna was well established as the cause of strand scissionbecause the concentration of copper is significantly very highin various malignancies egcg could induce cancer celldeath through the metal iondependent

highertherapeutic outcomes   drug resistance is a dauntingchallenge in cancers prooxidant activities of egcg wereproposed to contribute to overcoming drug resistancehighlighted by the fact that h2o2

diï¬erently to cancer cells but eventuallycause cell damage and death cancer initiation and progression are generally divided into several stages when egcgacts as an antioxidant it might more eï¬ectively enhance antioxidant capacity at the cancer prevention stage whereaswhen egcg acts as a prooxidant it might be more criticalat suppressing tumor growth stage one possible suppositionis that tumor cells may be more susceptible to oxidativestress because their increased growth rate and metabolismcause a heightened basal ros level the degree of cell proliferation and diï¬erentiation seems to be one factor aï¬ectingthe ros production ability of egcg future research willbe required to determine if egcg is a much more potentros inducer in diï¬erentiated than in undiï¬erentiated cancercells although a limited amount of data has shown that theseprooxidant eï¬ects can occur in vivo it is essential to understand when and to what extent the antioxidant or prooxidanteï¬ects of egcg are working in diï¬erent stages of cancers inanimal models prooxidant and antiobesity eï¬ects of egcg obesity is ametabolic disease characterized by abnormal or excessive fataccumulation it is generally associated with an increased riskof chronic diseases including diabetes hypertension anddyslipidemia   a large and growing body of studies hasinvestigated the antiobesity eï¬ects of egcg in cellular andanimal experiments and the underlying mechanismsthe clinical manifestations of obesity are adipocytehyperplasia and hypertrophy in vitro studies have well demonstrated that egcg could inhibit adipocyte growth andinduce adipocyte death through its prooxidant eï¬ects hung  reported that high concentrations of egcg  Î¼m reduced the cell viability of preadipocytes by  induced the appearance of dna fragmentation andincreased the activity of the apoptotic enzyme caspase3  egcg was demonstrated to raise ros level anddescend gsh level in preadipocytes and adipocytes whichinduced oxidative stress thus resulting in decreased cell number  ²ampregulated protein kinase ampk represents ametabolitesensing protein kinase hwang    foundthat the release of ros by egcg stimulation could furtheractivate ampk rapidly in 3t3l1 adipocytes a recent studyalso proved that ampk was activated by exogenous h2o2and this activation was not through direct redox signalingto ampk but was a secondary consequence of redox eï¬ectson other processes  egcg activates ampk via the generation of ros subsequently blocks anabolic pathways and promotes the catabolicpathway and suppresses gluconeogenesis and adipogenesisconsequently leading to body weight reduction and metabolic syndrome alleviation figure  the activation ofampk modulates the expression of genes and proteinsinvolved in lipid metabolism downregulates the expressionof fat synthesis proteins and upregulates lipid catabolismproteins   it was shown that egcg inhibited the expressions of glucose 6phosphatase g6pase for

importantpathogenic mechanism of obesityrelated metabolic syndrome such as diabetes firm conclusions as to whetherprooxidant eï¬ects of egcg could perform on body weightbody fat and adipose weight in humans will require morethorough clinical studies prooxidant and antibacterial eï¬ects of egcg egcgexhibits a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against various bacteria its bactericidal eï¬ects include damage to thebacterial cell membrane and inhibition of fatty acid synthesisand enzymatic activity   h2o2 which is generated byegcg appears to play an indispensable role in the bactericidal actions of egcg the bactericidal action of egcgwas related to h2o2 level as bactericidal action was inhibitedby the increase of cat concentration   egcg was foundto have bactericidal activity at higher concentrations in thesalmonella assay highly correlated with h2o2 production  egcg showed a dosedependent  Î¼m inhibition on escherichia coli e coli op50 strain growth  this inhibitory action was associated with a profoundincrease in intracellular oxidative stress caused by egcghence the use of egcg as a prooxidant is well supportedby these studiesegcg was shown to have broad antibacterial spectrumeï¬ects on both grampositive and gramnegative bacterianevertheless egcg might function through diï¬erent mechanisms against grampositive and gramnegative bacteriaintracellular ros level was determined by ï¬ow cytometrythe results indicated that damage on gramnegative e colicell walls was induced by egcg depending on h2o2 release 0coxidative medicine and cellular longevity  in contrast the damages on grampositive staphylococcus aureus resulted from a combination between egcg andpeptidoglycan layer   because the outer membrane ofgramnegative bacteria was mainly composed of negativelycharged lipopolysaccharides which could resist the destruction of egcg they are less susceptible to egcg thangrampositive bacteria  bacterial cell membrane damage not only prevents thebinding of bacteria to host cells but also inhibits the abilityof the bacteria to combine with each other and form bioï¬lms  egcg was known to attack the lipid bilayer of bacterialcell membranes leading to physical disruption of the membrane   as for the cell walls results from atomic forcemicroscopy suggested that the subminimum inhibitory concentrations of egcg treatment  mgl to e colio157h7 strains could lead to temporary changes in the cellwalls cui    such changes were due to the damagecaused by h2o2 generated from egcg moreover egcgcaused cell membrane damage via increased intracellularros level and led to potassium leakage these are potentiallyconducive to the antibioï¬lm eï¬cacy of egcg against vibriomimicus which is a foodborne pathogen in seafood andwater  in addition egcg also regulates the expression of oxidative stressrelated genes oxyr and soxrs systems are activated upon exposure to oxidative stress oxyr induces katgand soxrs induce soda strongly when cells are stressed byexogenous h2o2   egcg treatment upregulated katgand soda expression in e coli these results veriï¬ed the roleof ros in egcgmediated bacterial inhibition   the cpxsystem is thought to control protein homeostasis in the cellenvelope when e coli was exposed to egcg apoptosis happened because of ros formation by the cpx system  rpos is a general stress regulator in response to oxidativestress egcg could cause a reduction in the expression forrpos indicating that egcg induced oxidative stress in bacterium models  the potential prooxidant properties of egcg could beattributedin part to its suppressive eï¬ects on bacteriamore broadly research is also needed to determine relativesignaling pathways and proteomic factors egcg is superexcellent natural products it

7547,Colon_Cancer,""" breast cancer bc is the most commonly diagnosed malignant cancer in women bc is the main cause of cancerrelated death in women and seriously threatens the life and health of women worldwide micrornas mirnasmirs have been reported to regulate the development and progression of different types of cancer however the regulatory functions of mir1885p in bc have not been thoroughly demonstrated in this present research we identified that mir5p was downregulated  in  bc  tissues  and  several  bc cell  lines downregulation of mir5p was significantly associated with advanced tnm stage moreover we identified that mir5p mimics significantly inhibited proliferation using cck8 assay colony formation and xenograft animal model suppressed invasion and migration detected by transwell invasion assay and increased the cellular apoptosis of bc cells as determined by cell apoptosis assay moreover mir1885p mimics also reduced the expression of nfÎºb p65rel to further investigate its regulatory mechanism transcription factor zinc finger protein  zfp91 was predicted as the targeted protein of mir1885p by bioinformatic method we confirmed their specific binding by dual luciferase dlr assay we demonstrated that the overexpression of mir1885p significantly inhibited the expression of zfp91 in bc cell lines and reduced the expression of nfÎºb p65rel an inverse correlation was found between the expression of mir1885p and zfp91 in bc  tissues importantly we demonstrated that the restoration of zfp91 was able to block the effect of mir1885p on the progression of mdamb231 cells therefore our study showed that mir1885p may be one of the important indicators and could inhibit the progression of human bc via targeting the zfp91nfÎºb p65rel

of the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the world the mortality rate for bc ranks first among all female malignant tumors  globally the number of newly diagnosed bc cases reached approximately  million in  accounting for almost  of cancer cases among women  bc exhibits a complex pathogenesis and is a clinically heterogeneous disease with a wide range of clinical behaviors and treatment responses  although many dysregulated molecular pathways have been discovered in bc the development of effective therapeutic methods has been limited  it is urgent to discover novel molecules to suppress bc proliferation induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion and provide potential therapeutic strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of bc patients micrornas mirnasmirs are a class of endogenous noncoding rnas of approximately  nucleotides in length which are generally located in unstable regions of the human genome and are usually dysregulated in malignant tumors to regulate gene functions  mirnas regulate target genes through binding to the 'untranslated regions 'utrs of the target mrnas subsequently inhibiting gene expression  through regulation of the targeted proteins mirnas play an important role in many tumor cellular processes such as proliferation cell cycle apoptosis invasion and metastasis and participate in almost all signaling pathways mir1885p has been reported to be an inhibitor of tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer  and hepatocellular carcinoma  however to the best of our knowledge the functions of mir1885p in bc remain elusivein  the

that mir1885p was correlated with bc tnm stage fig 1b p005 the expression level of mir5p in advanced bc tumors was lower than that in early stage tumors suggesting that mir1885p is inversely

 showed  that  the  levels  of  mir1885p  in  the mdamb231 bt549 and mcf7 cells were lower than that in the mcf10a cells fig 1c p005 meanwhile the lowest mir1885p expression was detected in mdamb231 therefore  mdamb231  cells  were  selected  for  further experimentsmir5p inhibits proliferation induces cell apoptosis and suppresses migration and invasion of bc cells as the expression of mir1885p in both bc cell lines and tumor tissues of bc patients were clearly downregulated we sought to investigate the effects of mir1885p on bc development by using both in vitro bc cell line

the basement membrane and stimulate tumor growth metastasis and epithelialmesenchymal transition emt  mir5p mimics were demonstrated to significantly inhibit the expression of mmp2 and mmp9 fig 2f p005 these data provide robust evidence that mir1885p inhibits the tumor proliferation induces apoptosis reduces tumor invasion and migration and inhibits emt of bc which may be through the regulation

in summary these results illustrated that the mir5pzfp91 axis regulates the progression of bc via the noncanonical nfÎºb signaling pathwaydiscussionbreast cancer bc is one of the most common types of tumors diagnosed in women worldwide  bc is the second leading cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide   in  more than  women were diagnosed with bc in china and almost  percent of all newly diagnosed cancer cases were in women  however the molecular mechanisms of bc still await elucidation and effective molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment of bc are urgently required  recently  research  has  reported  that  mirnas  are  small noncoding rna molecules which regulate target protein expression to play critical roles as tumorpromotors or suppressors  several studies have demonstrated that mir1885p promotes cell proliferation migration and metastasis in gastric cancer  and hepatocellular carcinoma  moreover iwakawa   detected higher expression of mir1885p in stage

mir1885p and bc patient prognosis we found that kaplanmeier analysis of mir1885p was limited due to the small sample size in tcga these results illustrated that the downregulation of mir1885p may be related with bc progression in the clinic suggesting that mir1885p may be a valuable bc diagnostic indicator moreover we confirmed that mir1885p mimics considerably inhibited the proliferation induced the apoptosis and inhibited the invasion of bc cells suggesting that mir1885p plays an inhibitory role in bc cellstranscription factor zinc finger protein  zfp91 was firstly identified in the mouse in   which was found to be overexpressed in colon  liver prostate stomach  and breast cancer  zfp91 has a molecular mass of  kda with  amino acids containing five zincfinger motives a leucine zipper a coiledcoil structure and nuclear localization sequences zfp91 was confirmed to be a transcription factor located in the cellular nucleus  ma   reported that zfp91 functions as an oncogene in cancer development by activating hif1Î± transcription  the overexpression of zfp91  0concology reports      was also found to result in the promotion of nkÎºb signaling pathway activation through increasing nkÎºb inducing kinase nik  whose activity and overexpression are related to cancer progression in melanoma pancreatic breast and lung cancer  the inhibition of zfp91 was demonstrated to promote apoptosis in bc stomach cancer cells  colon cancer and endometrial cancer  in addition the overexpression of zfp91 was found to increase the cancer cell growth rate and metastatic capability  zfp91 was also reported to interact with cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2a cdkn2a which is an alternative reading frame arf tumor suppressor inhibiting the induction of p53dependent cell death  to illuminate the molecular mechanisms of mir188 we predicted that il6st foxn2 zfp91 may be the targets of mir5p using targetscan and miranda furthermore peng   reported that zfp91 is the target protein of mir5p in gastric cancer  in addition overexpression of mir1885p was confirmed to inhibit the progression of breast cancer thus we chose the reported oncogene zfp91 for further investigation in the present study we confirmed that the 'untranslated region 'utr of zfp91 was bound by mir5p through dual luciferase assay moreover transfection of mir1885p mimics in mdamb cells reduced the zfp91 mrna and protein levels together mirnas usually bind to the 'utrs of target mrnas and do not reduce the level of mrnas however mirnas also were reported to decay the target mrnas and decease mrna level  restoration of zfp91 largely reversed the decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis which were both regulated by mir1885p overexpression moreover in the tumor xenograft mouse model we observed that  the  expression  of  zfp91  was  downregulated  by  an increased level of mir1885p furthermore the expression of mir5p and zfp91 were negatively correlated in bc patient tissues therefore our studies confirmed that mir5p can inhibit the progression of human bc via targeting zfp91zfp91 has been reported to promote proliferation in colon cancer  prostate cancer  and gastric cancer  ma   reported that zfp91 activates nfkappabp65 to promote proliferation and tumorigenesis of colon cancer  paschke   identified that zfp91 is a noncanonical nfÎºb signaling pathway regulator with oncogenic properties in prostate cancer  in the present study we also confirmed that a decrease in zfp91 could significantly inhibit nfÎºbp65 and relb expression in bc cells therefore mir1885p overexpression reduced zfp91 via the noncanonical nfÎºb signaling pathway to inhibit the progression of bcin conclusion our data showed that mir1885p is downregulated in bc cell lines and tissues and the downregulated expression of mir1885p is associated with the poor prognosis of patients with bc we further investigated that overexpression of mir1885p could inhibit proliferation and induce the apoptosis of mdamb cells furthermore zfp91 was predicted and confirmed as a target gene of mirna5p and the effects of mir1885p on bc cells were dependent on the inhibition of zfp91 additionally a decrease in zfp91 significantly inhibited the nfÎºbp65 and relb expression in bc cells moreover the expression levels of mir5p and zfp91 were highly correlated with bc progression therefore we suggest that mir1885p can inhibit breast cancer progression via the zfp91nfÎºbp65 axis and may be a potential diagnostic indicator for bcacknowledgementsnot applicablefundingthis study

7548,Colon_Cancer,""" lung carcinoma is a prominent cause of mortality among patients with cancer previous studies have reported the vital role of long noncoding rnas lncrnas in the malignant progression of lung cancer lncrna rp11284f219 was originally identified to be expressed in lung carcinoma but its specific function remains unknown therefore the present study aimed to elucidate the role of lncrna rp11284f219 in lung carcinoma progression the expression of rp11284f219 in lung cell lines and tissues was measured using reverse transcriptionquantitative pcr the endogenous expression of rp11284f219 was silenced using rna interference and cell viabilities were measured with a cell counting kit assay the invasion and apoptosis of cells were determined via transwell assays and flow cytometry respectively the protein expression levels were measured by western blotting an increased expression of rp11284f219 was identified in both lung carcinoma tissues and cells knockdown of rp11284f219 in lung carcinoma cells inhibited cell proliferation and invasion but promoted cell apoptosis the present study identified the existence of a direct interaction between rp11284f219 and microrna mirnamir6273p mechanistically it was demonstrated that rp11284f219 promoted the proliferation and invasiveness of lung carcinoma cells in part via the regulation of mir6273p furthermore cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator  ccar1 was identified as a target gene of mir6273p the in vivo tumor growth assay also demonstrated that the knockdown of rp11284f219

second among different cancer types in terms of mortality and morbidity respectively in both men and women  furthermore  of lung cancer cases are categorized as nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc while the remaining  are classified as sclc  although diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies based on traditional surgical excision chemotherapy and chest radiotherapy have continuously improved the prognosis of lung carcinoma remains at  for an overall 5year survival  therefore an increased understanding of the malignant progression and studies on novel therapeutic targets for the improved management of this disease are essentiallong noncoding rnas lncrnas are  nucleotides in length and have little or no protein coding capacity  the mechanisms via which lncrnas regulate gene expression are diverse and include regulating the transcription of target genes functioning as transcriptional precursors of small rnas generating different splice variants via regulating mrna splicing patterns modulating protein activity and subcellular localization and scaffolding for the assembly of multiple component complexes in recent years previous studies have reported that various human cancer types exhibit lncrnas dysfunction and these lncrnas are involved in different aspects of pathogenesis such as the proliferation metastasis and apoptosis of tumor cells  in lung cancer lncrna metastasisassociated lung adenocarcinoma transcript  is found to be upregulated in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and may serve as a prognostic marker to predict the survival outcome of patients with cancer  lncrna hox transcript antisense rna is also highly expressed in lung cancer  and it enhances the aggressiveness of lymph node metastasis and indicates a short diseasefree survival in patients with nsclc  furthermore studies have shown that the expression of lncrna urothelial carcinomaassociated   0cli    rp11284f219 promotes lung carcinoma proliferation and

7550,Colon_Cancer,"""it is well understood that the level of molecular oxygen o2 in tissue is a very important factor impacting both physiology and pathological processes as well as responsiveness to some treatments data on o2 in tissue could be effectively utilized to enhance precision medicine however the nature of the data that can be obtained using existing clinically applicable techniques is often misunderstood and this can confound the effective use of the information attempts to make clinical measurements of o2 in tissues will inevitably provide data that are aggregated over time and space and therefore will not fully represent the inherent heterogeneity of o2 in tissues additionally the nature of existing techniques to measure o2 may result in uneven sampling of the volume of interest and therefore may not provide accurate information on the average o2 in the measured volume by recognizing the potential limitations of the o2 measurements one can focus on the important and useful information that can be obtained from these techniques the most valuable clinical characterizations of oxygen are likely to be derived from a series of measurements that provide data about factors that can change levels of o2 which then can be exploited both diagnostically and therapeutically the clinical utility of such data ultimately needs to be verified by careful studies of

overall goal of this review is to facilitate clinically effective use of measurements of molecular oxygen o2 in tissues with the explicit intent of improving clinical care that is improving the accuracy and effectiveness of diagnoses treatments  and  prognoses  for  individual  patients  this  review focusses especially on improving personalized medicine and outcomes of care by carefully considering the basis and validity of clinical measurements of o2 in tissues and how those measurements can be used to advance diagnosis and therapy while measurements of o2 in tissues have been recognized as an important factor in the clinical evaluation and treatment of  many  diseases  especially  cancer  busk  overgaard   horsman a0 and pathologies involving ischemia such as in peripheral vascular disease and wound healing insufficient attention often has been paid to the meaning of the values that have been obtained note this review is derived in part from a series of recent papers on this topic flood et a0al a0 swartz flood    swartz vaupel   instead all too often when a measurement technique has indicated that the level of o2 in a given tissue is x that is is some specific quantitative number for the o2 in the tissue researchers and clinicians alike assume that x is a reliable accurate representation of the true oxygenation status of the tissue this approach ignores the complexity and dynamics of o2 in living biological systems the reality is that any o2 measurement has been taken at only one point in time of a distribution in the subvolume that was interrogated by the method while the o2 is in fact varying with time and across space in the tissue and is unlikely to be uniform in the volume that is being interrogatedin this review we focus on the biologicalclinical meaningfulness of o2 measurements made in living anisms while recognizing that tissue o2 is in constant flux we emphasize that to obtain maximum clinical utility of the measurements it is necessary to consider the goal of the measurements and the limitations of the data that are obtained we particularly focus on the clinical value of making repeated measurements of o2 especially in association with strategiesevents that potentially change o2 levels  what are oxygen levels   physical concepts and terminology for  in tissues reporting on oxygen levels in tissuesthe level of molecular oxygen that is o2 is usually reported as partial pressure of oxygen po2 or concentration of oxygen  [o2]  or  co2  these  terms  have  physically  rigorous meanings  that  can  usefully  be  extended  to  describe  gases such as o2 that are dissolved in liquids or solids including tissues partial pressure is the pressure exerted by oxygen in a mixture of gases while concentration is the content of oxygen in the gas mixture or solid partial pressure is commonly expressed in mmhg and these units are sometimes referred to as torr or kpa si unit used in the eu while concentration of o2 is commonly expressed in ml of o2 per  a0ml for example in bloodhowever the solubility of oxygen varies greatly in different media bennett swartz brown  koenig a0 jordan et a0al a0 and this affects the relationship between po2 and [o2] the transport of o2 across lipid membranes is known to depend on both diffusion and solubility in the bilayer and to  be  affected  by  changes  in  the  physical  state  and  by  the lipid composition especially the content of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids for example because o2 partitions preferentially into lipophilic media such as membranes the solubility of o2 in membranes is about four times greater than in  aqueous  solutions  m¶ller  et a0 al a0   this  difference has significant consequences for physical and chemical interactions involving molecular oxygen in biological systems because these interactions depend on the number of oxygen molecules that are present and their rate of diffusiondoes it matter clinically to know whether the technique is reporting [o2] or po2 while these measures are not identical there is a known relationship between them according to the ideal gas law po2 is directly proportional to concentration assuming the volume and temperature are constant that ispv  nrtwhere p a0 a0pressure po2 v a0 a0volume n a0 a0amount of substance [o2] r a0 a0ideal gas constant t a0 a0temperatureit is less straightforward in biological systems if the solubility of oxygen in each component of tissue is known and this is not always fairly readily derived experimentally and po2 can be measured then it is relatively straightforward to calculate [o2] conversely if the component in which [o2] is measured and the solubility of o2 in that compartment is sufficiently known then it should be feasible to determine po2 however it often is not feasible to measure these parameters readilybecause of the biological complexities in assessing o2 in tissues each reported measure of o2 level in a tissue can be better considered as an average value average is used here in its more colloquial usage rather than as a statistically defined term because different techniques output their measurement of  o2  using  differing  methods  pertinent  to  that  technique each technique gathers information from a particular volume of tissue irrespective of whether that volume is well characterized which we refer to hereafter as the interrogated swartz   0cvolume the sampling of data within the interrogated volume is then used to produce a measure based on a sort of average o2 within that volume characterizing that average measure is made difficult both by the imprecision of knowing the exact volume queried but also because the detection of o2 in that volume may be affected by factors such as its distance from the detector or for optical techniques different rates of scattering that also may not be well characterized hence we conclude that it is important to bear in mind that the measurements of o2 in vivo are fundamentally based on a sort of average within the interrogated volumebecause  of  all  of  these  challenges  in  obtaining  precise measurements  of  relevant  parameters  necessary  to  assess whether the data obtained by any technique is truly measuring either po2 or [o2] and because of the imprecisions of knowing the volume being assessed and the tissues within that  volume  it  is  more  realistic  to  acknowledge  the  complexity of these issues for in vivo measurements in tissues by using a less precise term for measures of molecular oxygen in tissues such as o2 levels which is the convention we follow in this review we also argue that while it is important to recognize the biological imprecisions in these measures there are still many clinically viable uses of this information such as assessing change in o2 levelsnote  too  within  this  paper  while  focusing  on  the  uncertainties  due  to  sampling  issues  of  each  technique  and variations due to biological factors we are not taking into consideration further uncertainties due to inevitable instrumental noise variations in the placement of the detector etc  expected levels of o2 in tissues table a0 presents some illustrative data on the o2 levels in various tissues both in normal states and as altered by some diseases these measures are presented here as reported in the  literature  the  first  column  presents  the  median  po2 obtained using the eppendorf electrode or comparable polarographic techniques to measure o2 levels in patients also presented are two other indications of o2 levels the hypoxic fraction the percentage of measurements in a given type of tissue that is below a defined hypoxic level in this case  a0mmhg and the range of po2 values found experimentally these data illustrate both the variation in median o2 levels between types of tissues and how they may vary with physiology or disease for example intertissue in general the median o2 levels are lower in skeletal muscle and heart compared to the spleen intratissue the median o2 in skeletal muscle at rest is higher than with exercise while in contrast there is almost no variation between the normal spleen and with hodgkin's disease the data in column  illustrate the wide range that any given measurement can have in the same type of tissue that is almost all tissues range from         of to  a0mmhg even when their median value is quite different see again spleen vs bone however these very high values in the upper range may include experimental artifacts due to the measurement being taken within or very close to an arteriole for example a vessel feeding the microcirculatory bedtable a0 presents the same types of information for a more detailed analysis of changes in an important pathology cancer where o2 levels have been an especially important focus for informing clinical treatment and prognosis to give the reader a sense of how well supported the numbers are the data in table a0 have been ordered by the number of patients included in each rowof interest here all seven cancer types with at least  patients studied have a fairly consistent and fairly hypoxic median o2 level  a0mmhg similarly all but soft tissue sarcoma have a similar hypoxic fraction  sarcoma appears to be about half that glioma appears to be an outlier on the range glioma had no patient whose o2 level was above  while all others as was true for the tissues in table a0 have at least one measurement in the upper 80s or 90s these occasional high readings are not surprising since it is plausible that randomly some readings will have been obtained in or very near to arteriolesfeeding microvessels in contrast to the first seven cancers the  types of cancers with fewer than  patients appear to be more varied in their o2 levels but this is possibly due to being based on few patientsnevertheless  even  though  as  noted  elsewhere  in  this review  the  data  presented  are  not  unconditionally  absolute values of o2 levels as they are sometimes referred to eg koch a0 macnab gagnon gagnon minchinton  fry a0 nevertheless as argued in this review they can provide very useful data as long as their limitations are recognized by researchers and clinicians  heterogeneity of  distributions of levels of oxygen in tissues examples and causesheterogeneity of distributions of

paper oxygen was measured along several electrode tracks in each individual during a given measurement session from near the tumor surface up to tissue depths of a0 a0 a0mm in breast cancers and in cancers of the uterine cervix each row in figure a0 presents a type of tissue breast and uterine cervix with comparisons of o2 levels made in normal  tissue  green  versus  malignancies  prior  to  treatment of these ans red the summary measures median po2 values parallel to data reported in tables a0 and  are included in the text boxesnote that the data in figure a0 are not normally distributed  the  distribution  of  o2  levels  made  in  normal  breast tissue is the closest approximation to a normal distribution comparing  the  two  distributions  for  malignancies  we  see that breast cancer is more highly skewed than cervical cancer although they have the same median thus using a single measure such as the median could overlook potentially important clinical informationsimilarly comparing the distributions for the normal tissues the normal cervix had a substantial number of o2 measurements  within  a  hypoxic  range  defined  as  ¤ a0 mmhg while  there  were  no  hypoxic  measurements  in  the  normal breast while figure a0 does not differentiate the measurements made per patient it illustrates why several authors report the hypoxic fraction when trying to capture a meaningful overall number to characterize a tissue finally these data underscore why it is important to understand what is well captured by a given measure of o2 leveland what is missed or obscuredanother example of heterogeneity is presented in figure a0 these o2 measurements were taken in a breast cancer patient using  epr  oximetry  with  carlo  erba  ink  as  the  o2  sensor flood et a0al a0 jeong et a0al a0 the data are presented as  line  widths  because  the  epr  oximetry  technique  using india ink as a sensor undoubtably gathers data from volumes too large to have homogenous oxygen levels however because this sensor remains in the same place in the tissue it still can provide very useful indications of changes over time andor the impact of interventions such as breathing enriched oxygen the data were taken in 30min sessions during which epr spectra were collected continuously but the period was divided into three 10min periods differing by the gas mixture the patient was breathing room air red baseline  o2 delivered by a nonrebreather mask green followed by again breathing room air blue recovery the sessions were repeated approximately weekly throughout the period of radiation therapy thus mimicking a clinical course of radiation therapy although there was no attempt to impact therapy in this studythe data for this particular patient illustrate that the o2 levels responded to the patient's breathing an hyperoxic gas mixture and then returned rapidly to the baseline level after the 10min period  in  this  patient  there  appeared  to  be  some  variation across the weeks of treatment with the final levels for each period baseline  o2 and recovery all being slightly higher than at the beginning of radiation therapy based on nonoverlapping standard deviations of the first and last measurements  causes of heterogeneity  in normal tissuesthere are spatial variances in oxygen levels in normal tissues due to the longitudinal gradient in oxygen as the blood passes through the microcirculatory bed decreasing from the arterial inlet to the outlet of the microvessels erickson    after the oxygen leaves the microvascular networks the partial pressure of o2 decreases due to radial gradients that is o2 diffuses through the tissues as it gets further from the vessels due to o2 being consumed by the cells as a result there are variations in o2 levels from cell to cell according to their distance from the microvessel within the cells o2 decreases in a microspatially complex manner as it is intracellularly consumed with most of the consumption occurring in the mitochondria there is growing evidence that diffusion of o2 into the cell may be constrained that is that o2 does not freely and rapidly flow into cells

of the brain between subepicardial and subendocardial layers of the myocardium and between renal cortex and renal inner medullathere also are temporal changes in o2 levels in normal tissues griffith a0 moreover the supply of o2 can vary periodically due to rhythmic changes in microcirculatory blood flow which is reflected at all levels from the inflow arteries to the microcirculation finally within the microcirculation there are variations in microvascular flow due to regional regulation in response to varying metabolic demands kimura et a0al a0 important differences in o2 solubility across tissues affecting the relationship between po2 and [o2] were discussed earlier  impact of pathology on  heterogeneity of o2 levelsthe  presence  of  pathology  often  significantly  increases  the amount and extent of oxygen heterogeneity both spatially and temporally vaupel  harrison  vaupel  mayer a0 the presence of pathology often impacts the structuremorphology of the vessels in tumors there often is a significant amount of neoangiogenesis which results in much less ordered and less functional blood vessels busk et a0al a0 the resulting vessels are much less efficient in delivering blood and also tend to be much more prone to leak leakage from these vessels can cause increases in the interstitial pressure which can reduce the effectiveness of the microcirculation due to reduction of the perfusion pressure within the tumor capillaries fukumura duda munn  jain a0pathological changes also can result in altered consumption of o2 in malignant tumors o2 consumption is likely to  decrease  due  to  poor  oxygen  delivery  andor  because of a switch to glycolysis due to metabolic reprogramming ie the warburg effect as a consequence of hif1Î± overexpression

line width increases with increasing o2 level but the relationship is nonlinear and can be impacted by several factors therefore the data are given here as line widthmetabolic abnormalities in diabetes can impact the structure of blood vessels causing either microangiopathy andor  macroangiopathy  the  results  of  these  processes  can produce very significant local variations in the availability of fully functional vascular structures resulting in locally hypoxic regionsswartz   0c of     pathology also can impact temporal changes of oxygen and the  response  to  treatment  the  presence  of  pathology  especially cancer eg acute and cycling hypoxia in cancers and peripheral vascular disease can result in significantly greater variability  in  o2  levels  braun  lanzen    dewhirst a0  these include shortterm changes especially associated with the structural abnormalities of the microcirculation resulting in increased local variability in flow and longterm changes that develop over time such as those due to disease progression and responses to therapy baudelet et a0al a0 kimura et a0al a0 konerding fait  gaumann a0 matsumoto   there also is a potential for pathologies to interrelate with each other for example anemic hypoxia can develop in tumors due to the underlying systemic anemia of the patient vaupel  mayer a0in addition to these underlying effects of pathology on tissue oxygen levels any applied therapeutic interventions are very likely to induce changes for example cell killing due to radiation or chemotherapy will alter oxygen consumption patterns these same therapies will also affect the o2 supplying vasculature via both antiangiogenic effects andpossiblynormalization of vessel structure jain a0 the effects of therapies will generally vary both spatially and temporally reiterating the complexity of meaningfully characterizing tissue oxygen levels  analysis of the ability  of clinically available techniques to directly measure levels of o2 in tissues andor resolve the heterogeneity of o2 distributions in tissuesalthough  many  techniques  are  often  thought  to  measure actual o2 in tissues only a few actually have the potential to make o2 measurements directly in the tissues of interest springett  swartz a0 tatum    techniques that can potentially assess o2 directly in tissues include epr epel et a0al a0 swartz et a0al a0 swartz    the eppendorf electrode vaupel h¶ckel  mayer a0 some optical methods based on direct measurements of target molecules in tissues for example phosphorescence quenching of optical sensors placed directly in tissues or as part of a physical probe such as the oxylite wen et a0al a0 and nmr relaxation techniques colliez et a0al a0two other types of measurements assess o2 in the vascular  system  blood  gases  do  this  directly  while  optical methods that measure both hemoglobin saturation and total hemoglobin especially near infrared spectroscopy [nirs] scheeren schober  schwarte a0 provide a plausible link to the po2 in the bloodhowever the techniques most often used clinically to characterize tissue oxygenation do not in fact measure o2 directly instead they measure indirect parameters that can be plausibly linked to actual o2 levels but only under appropriatedefined circumstances this latter group of techniques includes positron emission tomography pet imaging of glucose derivatives neveu et a0al a0 pet imaging of drugs that localize in hypoxic tissues tran    laser doppler flow measures of metabolites that may be affected by o2 levels for example lactate and redox intermediates and several magnetic resonance imagingnuclear magnetic resonance mrinmr blood oxygenation level dependent bold imaging baudelet  gallez a0 and mri egeland et a0al a0 note if their basis is understood and the data considered accordingly these can all provide clinically and physiologically useful information even though they do not provide direct information on the amount of o2 in the tissues  direct measures of o2 in targeted  tissues that potentially can be used in human subjectsthese are techniques that while they have the capability of providing direct quantitative measurements of o2 in homogeneous media cannot provide such data in tissues in vivo because the volumes that they sense are larger than the volumes of homogeneity of o2 in actively metabolizing tissues consequently all in vivo measurements of o2 are inherently averages of the actual oxygen content in that volume even neglecting  the  need  to  include  measures  of  heterogeneity inside cells based on the usual volume of cells and assuming  that  differences  are  sought  for  aggregates  of  ¤  cells for a measurement of heterogeneity sensed within a  a0mm diameter volume the spatial resolution needed to appropriately characterize o2 levels in this volume becomes  million voxels the measuring techniques may not even provide a welldefined averaged po2 value within the volume that they sense for example sensors for the signal that is being measuredin the next sections we review the characteristics of each technique that can directly measure o2 levels in tissues we also briefly remark on the volumes they measure and how the measures obtained can be useful clinically see also ortezprado dunn vasconez castillo  visco   epr oximetry using appropriate particulate paramagnetic materials epr oximetry can provide direct measurements of o2 that is the epr signal is directly proportional to the amount of o2 epel bowman mailer  halpern a0 swartz vaupel   swartz   0cthe  because each multisite sensor senses a volume that is much larger than capillary networks these techniques provide a volume averaged sampling of all compartments within the tissues the time resolution of the techniques can be milliseconds or shorterthe measured parameter of an epr spectrum that indicates the amount of o2 present is the line width of the observed resonance peak there usually is a fixed relationship between the line width and the amount of o2 with the relationship being specific for each type of paramagnetic material for example carbon charcoal or phthalocyanine particulates  using  particulate  oximetric  materials  measurements  can  be  continuous  over  any  span  of  time  and can be repeated indefinitely see example in figure a0 the method  requires  that  the  sensing  material  be  injected  or implanted in one or more regions of interest but thereafter all measurements can be made entirely noninvasively importantly the measurements can be carried out in a clinical setting and can fit into the workflow needed for patient careinitial  clinical  epr  measurements  of  oxygen  in  tissues  have  used  india  ink  as  the  oxygen  sensor swartz et a0al a0 the carbon ps are the components that respond to oxygen lan beghein charlier  gallez a0 after injection of  a0µl of the suspension through a small needle the carbon ps disperse nonuniformly through the local region as small extracellular aggregates they are often engulfed by macrophages the resulting epr spectra in the region probed by the resonator  ie  the  surface  coil  used  for  signal  detection  are  a composite of the oxygendependent line widths from each of the ps in reality because of the relatively broad lines from the india ink ps the range of oxygen levels that are likely to be present in the tissue and the limited number of ps in each subregion it is a challenge to  resolve  directly  even  the  major  groups  of  similar  line widths therefore using the observed line width to provide a quantitative measure of oxygen would seem to have modest utility in itselfthe other method of clinical epr oximetry is based on the use of microcrystalline probes eg lipc lincbuo encapsulated in biocompatible polymers swartz et a0al a0 clinical  measurements  currently  are  being  performed using  the  oxychip  which  consists  of  oxygen  sensitive

7552,Colon_Cancer,aberrant activation of the wnt signalling pathway is required for tumour initiation and survival in the majority of colorectal cancers the development of inhibitors of wnt signallinghas been the focus of multiple drug discovery programs targeting colorectal cancer andother malignancies associated with aberrant pathway activation however progression ofnew clinical entities targeting the wnt pathway has been slow one challenge lies with thelimited predictive power of 2d cancer cell lines because they fail to fully recapitulate intratumoural phenotypic heterogeneity in particular the relationship between 2d cancer cell biology and cancer stem cell function is poorly understood by contrast 3d tumour anoidsprovide a platform in which complex cellcell interactions can be studied however complex3d models provide a challenging platform for the quantitative analysis of drug responses oftherapies that have differential effects on tumour cell subpopulations here we generatedtumour anoids from colorectal cancer patients and tested their responses to inhibitors oftankyrase tnksi which are known to modulate wnt signalling using compounds with orders of magnitude difference in cellular mechanistic potency together with imagebasedassays we demonstrate that morphometric analyses can capture subtle alterations in anoid responses to wnt inhibitors that are consistent with activity against a cancer stem cellsubpopulation overall our study highlights the value of phenotypic readouts as a quantitative method to asses druginduced effects

identifies responses to tankyrase inhibitorsintroductionaberrant canonical wntcatenin signalling as a result of activating mutations within thepathway has a prominent role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer crc   a number of feedback loops control catenin turnover and wnt activation in the absenceof a wnt ligand the multiprotein catenin destruction complex formed of axin12 adenomatous polyposis coli apc and glycogen synthase kinase gsk3 mark catenin for degradation   as a result the accumulation and subsequent translocation of catenin to thenucleus is inhibited preventing the downstream activation of target genes   components ofthe destruction complex are also tightly regulated axin1 and axin2 are concentrationlimiting components of the destruction complex levels of axin12 are posttranscriptionally regulated by tankyrases tnks1 and tnks2 members of the poly adpribose polymerasesparp family of enzymes which enhance wnt signalling by targeting axin12 for degradation  the inhibition of wnt signalling has been validated as a means of blocking tumour growthin many cancer models [ ] small molecule inhibitors of tnks1 and tnks2 have beenshown to reduce wnt signalling in intestinal cancer cell lines and have been suggested to prevent tumour growth due to their ability to stabilise axin1 and axin2 levels and as a result toinhibit catenin mediated transcription [ ] however the progression of tnksi intoclinical trials has been restricted due to significant issues of intestinal toxicity within in vivomodels emphasising the important role of wnt signalling in adult tissue homeostasis    furthermore the tnksi described above reduced colorectal cancer cell numbers in 2dculture but did so with relatively low effect sizes by comparison with their ability to reduce levels of wnttcfdependent transcription in the same cell lines similar partialefficacy cell lineresponses were observed during the development of inhibitors of the cdk8 and cdk19kinases suggesting that growth in 2d cell culture may not be an optimal readout for compounds that are anticipated to target cancer stem cells  to date most preclinical in vitro studies have relied on the use of conventional 2d culturesof cell lines whilst cancer cell lines can be usefully used to study pathway deregulation theyfrequently fail to be predictive when used as readouts of antitumour efficacy   it is wellrecognised that immortalised 2d cell lines adapted to growth on plastic poorly represent theintricate cellular crosstalk present in tumours in particular they are unable to recapitulatethe intercellular interactions that form cancer stem cell niches and as a consequence suchmodels fail to fully reflect in vivo results3d tumour anoids have been shown to provide a more complex insight into tumourcellcell interactions [ ] and have been recognised as models with the potential to bridgethe gap between in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies anoids that have never beenadapted for growth on plastic have been cultured from multiple tumour types and have beenshown to better represent the genetic diversity of distinct tumour subtypes than 2d cell lines  anoids derived from geneticallyengineered mice in which the wnt pathway hadbeen oncogenicallyactivated accurately predicted subsequent in vivo responses to inhibitorsof the cdk8 and cdk19 kinases while 2d cell culture only showed partialefficacy   anoids have been further shown to predict patient responses and might in future be used in theclinic in personalised medicine  the biological and phenotypic complexity of 3d primary anoid cultures allow in principle the assessment of compound activity against a subset of intercellular signalling that is central to tumour growth however most uses of anoid assays to date have relied on fixedendpoint metabolic assays eg atplevel quantification that aggregates responses in everycell within a population of anoids to fully exploit the

diseases and cancersintroductioncancer is the second leading cause of death for both men and women in the united statesus   breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women   colorectal cancer ranks second among men and third among women   while cervical cancer ranksas a major cause of cancer death among women   regular cancer screenings for breast cervical and colorectal cancers can help to diagnose cancers early and reduce cancer deaths  for example in the past  years the number of deaths caused by cervical cancer has significantly decreased thanks to pap tests which can find abnormal cervical cells before they turn tocancer   similarly colonoscopy removes noncancerous colon polyps before becomingmalignant and regular mammography screening can identify breast cancer in an earliermore treatable stage thus breast cancer screening bcs cervical cancer screening cecsand colorectal cancer screening cocs are very important for early detection and treatmentfactors associated with cancer screenings include demographic factors health insurancecoverage education level smoking status obesity and cholesterol testing for example receiptof mammography is associated with modifiable factors such as weight smoking and other lifestyle factors [] receipt of cecs is associated with healthier weight   lower cardiovascular disease occurrence   and lower cholesterol   some studies suggest that smokingsedentary lifestyle high body mass index and high comorbidity are associated with a higherpercentage of cocs participation [] traditionally data for such studies originate fromquestionnaires claims data and telephone surveys and statistical analysis methods such aslogistic regression models are applied to examine the associations between the risk factors andcancer screenings electronic health records ehr contain longitudinal healthcare information and data including diagnoses medications procedures lab tests and images   andtherefore can be used to discover new patterns and relationships from the rich data deeplearning algorithms have been widely and successfully used in bioinformatics and healthcarefields as they can effectively capture

than  different clinics in theusthe comparison of different cvh measure distributions between patients who receivedcancer screenings and those who did not showed that patients with poorer cvh especiallypoor a1c were more likely to receive cancer screenings specifically patients with poorera1c were more likely to receive cancer screenings some recent studies have showed that individuals with diabetes had  higher incidence of certain cancers and also were more likely tobe diagnosed with advancedstage tumors [] thus providers might be more likely torecommend patients with diabetes to uptake cancer screenings for early prevention of developing cancers which may lead to more individuals with diabetes to participate in cancerscreeningsmoreover we investigated the effects of cancer screenings on the changes of cvh measuresof the patients to better understand if the screenings had potential associations with theimprovement of cvh measures our results indicated that patients who received cancerscreenings appeared to have better control of cvh factors especially a1c than patients whodid not receive cancer screenings specifically a1c levels were improved after patientsreceived any type of screening while a1c levels worsened among patients who did not receivecancer screening a similar trend could be observed for bmi it became better after patientsreceived any type of screening while bmi became worse among patients without bcs orcocs levels of bp were improved after patients received bcs or cocs screenings and worsened among patients without bcs or cocs poor levels of ldl decreased among patientsafter receipt of bcs and among those without bcs however ldl improvements were muchgreater among patients after receipt of bcs  decrease in ldl than those without bcs decrease in ldl after receipt of bcs and cocs current smoking declined comparedto the increase observed among those without the screeningsin summary our analyses showed that patients with poor cvh measures were more likelyto receive cancer screenings patients with receipt of cancer screenings appeared to haveimproved cvh measures after the screening as compared to before one possible reason forthis was that patients might receive more attention and through care from providers to detectand manage cvh by virtue of reviewing cancer screening and other risk factor data at thepopulation level better cvh is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease cvdand cancers   thus cancer screenings may indirectly decrease burden and cost on thehealth system eg cvd and cancers by improving patient cvh healthlimitationsthere were some limitations in our analyses we used values of auroc to evaluate associations between timeseries cvh measurements and receipt of cancer screenings higherauroc values indicated stronger associations between predictors and the binary outcomes  however our observed auroc values were relatively low and thus have limited clinicalutility at this time cancer screenings are potentially affected by cvh and other factors weacknowledge that we had relatively few patients with receipt of cancer screening specificallythere were relatively few patients who received cancer screenings compared to patients whodid not within the same age and gender groups this limitation likely affected the accuracy of one  101371 pone0236836 august     one

inactivation of a bluelight receptene white collar1 wc1 resulted in thicker aerial hyphae disordered development in c militaris   further study showed that the fruiting body primordia could form in the drosophilaarabidopsis synechocystis and human dash type cryptochromes crys gene mutantstrains but the fruiting bodies were unable to elongate normally and crydash and cmwc1exhibited interdependent expression under light in c militaris  compared to light temperature is another pivotal factor influencing fruiting body formation from a hyphal thallus which represents a transition from simple to complex multicellularity   the fruiting body formation of various mushrooms depends on low temperaturecold stress induction for example the fruiting body development was induced by shiftingthe cultivation condition Ëc for mycelia to lower temperature Ëc in flammulina velutipes   in pleurotus ostreatus the mycelia were cultured at Ëc for  days in a sawdustmedium and then the temperature was lowered to Ëc to induce fruiting body development  in c militaris after the mycelia were cultured under static conditions at Ëc on potatodextrose broth medium for  days the mycelia were injected into pupae and then the inoculated pupae were kept at Ëc to induce the fruiting bodies   however the molecular mechanism of mycelial development to fruiting body under cold induction has been subject tosurprisingly few studies which will seriously restrict the further development of commercialproduction of mushrooms fruiting bodiestwocomponent signal transduction is commonly used by eubacteria archea and eukaryotes as a stimulusresponse coupling mechanism to sense and respond to changes in many different environmental conditions especially temperature sensing   they consist of ahistidine kinase hk and a response regulator the histidine kinase desk from bacillus subtilis is mechanistically the best understood after a temperature downshift desk gets autophosphorylated at the conserved histidine residue and donates the phosphate group to theconserved aspartate residue of desr the phosphorylated desr activates the transcription ofthe des gene   however little is known the role of hk genes in cold stress response andfruiting body formation in c militaris and other mushroomforming fungidue to its high sensitivity specificity and reliable quantification realtime quantitativepolymerase chain reaction qrtpcr is an important tool to understand the complex signaling networks when an anism is submitted to different stimuli [ ] however the resultsof qrtpcr are often inaccurate because of the occurrence of errors in the primer specificitycomplementary dna cdna synthesis and pcr amplification   therefore qrtpcrmust be normalized using reference genes that show a stable expression however validationof suitable rgs for expression analysis under cold stress have not been conducted in c militaris and many other mushroomforming fungi in this study we systematically identified candidate rgs in c militaris that were measured using qrtpcr three different algorithmsgenorm normfinder and bestkeeper were applied to evaluate the expression stability of the candidate rgs under cold treatment in c militaris moreover the relative expression levelsof twocomponentsystem hk genes were analyzed under cold stress conditions with threedifferent normalization

the accuracy of qrtpcr results it is necessary to analyze the stability ofinternal rg under a specific experimental condition a previous study in c militaris showedthat polymerase ii large subunit

suggest to use two or more rgs rpb1 ubc and ubq tostudy the expression levels of the fruiting body developmental genes in c militaris in the followup studya large number of studies have been conducted to identify the suitable rgs under coldtreatment conditions among different species but the most stable rgs are diverse table  inpineapple ananas comosus l pp2a and cyp were the stable rgs under cold

thedevelopment causes discrepancies in the function and phenotype of the immune cells []overall highthroughput screening hts of therapeutic compounds using patientderivedcells or animal models is usually not feasiblethe establishment of disease or patientspecific induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs   has led to the development of a new field of disease modeling owing to their pluripotencyand capacity for selfrenewal ipscs can function as an unlimited source of patientderivedsomatic cells and progenitor cells ipscs have also been used as a source of phenotypebasedhts [] however several roadblocks remain for ipscbased hts as follows  obtaining alarge number of differentiated progenies from pscs is cost and laborintensive and  theyield and function of the differentiated cells often vary among clones and experimentalbatchesjapan society for the promotion of science jspswe have established ipscs from patients with autoinflammatory syndromes including neokakenhi grant number

nakajonishimura syndrome  and blau syndrome   for disease modeling in these studies ipscderived myeloid cells wereimmortalized by transducing lentiviral vectors that encoded myc bmi1 and mdm2   anddisease phenotypes were recapitulated in vitro thus ipscderived immortalized myeloid celllines ipsmls can be expanded from one experimental batch with reduced financial and laborcosts they also can be stored and differentiated into terminally differentiated progenies therefore ipsmls can overcome the roadblocks associated with ipscbased hts  nomid is the most severe form of cryopyrinassociated periodic syndrome caps anautoinflammatory disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the nlrp3 gene [ ]nacht lrr and pyd domainscontaining protein  nlrp3 is expressed mainly in myelomonocytic lineage cells and acts as a sensor of cellular stress induced by various pathogens andsterile stimuli   in normal macrophages a priming stimulus such as lipopolysaccharidelps induces the expression of nlrp3 and prointerleukin il1 an inactive form of theproinflammatory cytokine il1 then an activating stimulus such as adenosine triphosphate atp enhances the assembly of a protein complex known as nlrp3 inflammasomethis inflammasome contains the protease caspase1 which processes proil1 to the matureform on the other hand lps stimulation of monocytic cells obtained from untreated capspatients induces robust il1 secretion without secondary activating signals   due to autoactivation of nlrp3 inflammasome indeed antiil1 therapy for caps patients has beenproven effective [ ] however antiil1 therapy has several weak points the efficacy ofantiil1 therapy is often inadequate for patients with severe phenotypes   il1 maturation is mediated not only by nlrp3 inflammasome but also other inflammasomes and proteases [ ] thus a complete blockade of il1 may result in excessive immunosuppressionmoreover the cost and lifelong injection of biologics worsen the patients quality of life therefore other therapeutic approaches such as the direct inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasomeactivity are under considerationnlrp3 inflammasome is an attractive drug target because nlrp3 inflammasome activation is associated with the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory conditions  recently several selective nlrp3 inhibitors entered the clinical phase   their chemicalstructures are undisclosed but presumed to be sulfonylureas or their derivatives mcc950 asulfonylureabased potent selective inhibitor of nlrp3 inflammasome activation   wasalso recently identified as a direct nlrp3 inhibitor by binding to the walker b atphydrolysismotif of the nacht domain [ ] given that capsrelated mutations frequently occursin the nacht domain   it is not surprising that most capsrelated nlrp3 mutantsescape efficient mcc950 inhibition   therefore novel nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitorseffective for diseases including caps are sought one  101371 pone0237030 august     one 0cipscderived monocytic cell lines serves a platform for drug screeningin the present study we developed an hts system to identify compounds that regulate theactivity of nlrp3 inflammasome using ipscs generated from a nomid patient we established ipsmls which we used as a prototype of nlrp3activated immune cells by immortalizing ipscderived monocytic progenitor cells we conducted hts of approximately compounds and validated their inhibitory effect on the secretion of il1resultsfunctional monocytic cells on feeder and serumfree monolayer culturewe previously reported that macrophages derived from ipscs carrying diseaseassociatedmutations in the nlrp3 gene showed excessive secretion of il1 without secondary signals  these macrophages were considered functional based on compatible appearances withprimary macrophages under an electron microscope the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the phagocytosis of listeria monocytogenes macrophages in that study wereobtained via a differentiation protocol using op9 feeder layers recently we have updated ourmonocytemacrophage differentiation system to a defined condition without feeder cells andserums which can also produce functional macrophages   we therefore examined whethermonocytes obtained with the feeder and serumfree monolayer differentiation system exhibited a similar in vitro phenotypefor this a nlrp3mutated ipsc clone derived from a nomid patient with a somaticnlrp3y570c mutation was differentiated into monocyticlineage cells   since thenlrp3 mutation was a somatic mosaicism   the nlrp3nonmutated wildtype clonederived from the same donor was used as an isogenic control ipsc line the differentiatedcells showed a mononuclear and slightly foamy appearance consistent with the appearance ofin vitro differentiated monocytes fig 1a and expressed the hematopoietic cell marker cd45the myeloid cell marker cd11b and the monocytic cell marker cd14 fig 1bwe collected floating monocytic cells from the culture supernatant and evaluated theircytokine production we used lps as a priming signal and silica as a secondary inflammasomeactivating signal   as expected the wildtype ipscderived monocytes required twosequential signals to secrete il1 fig 1c while the monocytes carrying the nlrp3 mutationshowed excessive il1 secretion without a secondary signal fig 1d both clones showedrobust secretion of il6 confirming the appropriate downstream signal transduction of lpsstimulation fig 1c and 1d overall the monocytic cells differentiated under feeder andserumfree condition showed the abnormal il1 secretion associated with the in vitro phenotype of nomidestablishment of ipsmls from monocytic progenitor cellswe next established an ipsml line from the ipscderived monocytic cells for this we recovered monocytic lineage cells and introduced lentiviral vectors encoding myc bmi1 andmdm2   after  days culture in the presence of macrophage colonystimulating factormcsf the cells started to continuously proliferate in an exponential manner fig 2a theipsmls showed a small mononuclear appearance consistent with the appearance of monocyticlineage cells fig 2b the integration of transgenes into the genome of ipsmls was confirmed fig 2c the ipsmls expressed cd45 cd11b and cd14 similar to the originalipscderived monocytic cells fig 2d karyotype analysis of the ipsml demonstrated thatmost of the cells maintain normal karyotype except for some normal variations s1 tablebecause monocytes are heterogeneous progenitor cells that can differentiate into macrophagesand dendritic cells [ ] they might be composed of a heterogeneous population potentiallymaking their cytokine production insufficient we therefore compared the cytokine profiles of one  101371 pone0237030 august     one 0cipscderived

fig 3e allseven compounds have previously been reported to inhibit nlrp3 inflammasome []indicating their inhibitory effects on both wildtype and mutant cellsvalidation of hit compounds with primary human cellswe also wondered if the effect of these compounds could be recapitulated in primary humancells we used primary peripheral blood mononuculear cells pbmcs obtained from healthyvolunteers for

thevalidity of our strategy screening a larger number of compounds may help identify novel andmore specific compoundswe could efficiently immortalize monocytic progenitor cells derived from human

this manner the financial and labor costs of htscan be dramatically decreased our strategy can be applied to other immunological disordersin which monocytemacrophagelineage cells play critical pathological roles in addition theimmortalization of ipscderived hematopoietic cells for hts can be expanded to otherhematopoietic disorders one concern associated with the immortalization of monocytic cellsis that the immortalization can affect the characteristics of the cells especially regarding thecell cycle and death which may affect the immunological functions to avoid any potentialchanges in the cellular phenotype we first expanded the ipsmls generated a larger numberof frozen stocks and then used the same passage number of the stocks for a series of htssessionsmodulating the function of the inflammasome by small compounds is a promising frontierfor controlling diseases associated with inflammasomemediated chronic inflammation somecompounds such as mcc950 have already been shown to be markedly effective without anysignificant side effects in animal models nevertheless identifying more candidates to modulate nlrp3 inflammasome is desirable as mcc950 inefficiently inhibits capsrelated nlrp3mutants interestingly we identified several compounds effective in mutant cells that were previously reported to inhibit the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome indicating that the activation of mutant nlrp3 shares activating signals to some degree with wildtype nlrp3however several compounds that exerted predominantly il1 inhibitory effects on mutantcells were nonselective on pbmcs which could be explained by offtarget effects or false positives offtarget effects including cytotoxicity could be the result of a higher sensitivity bypbmcs to the true positives the clear reason is difficult to elucidate however because of theheterogeneity of the pbmc population on the other hand ipsmls consist of relativelyhomogenous cell populations and may therefore be more useful than primary cells in in vitro one  101371 pone0237030 august     one 0cipscderived monocytic cell lines serves a platform for drug screeningexperiments as for nonspecific inhibitors and false positives in hts the upregulation of certain signaling pathways irrelevant to the inflammasome in ipsmls might be one cause cytotoxic compounds may also suppress cytokine secretion in a nonspecific manneradditionally our hts system relies on the amount of secreted cytokines which can varybetween cells and only indirectly describes the inflammasome activity thus a combination ofmeasuring the cytotoxicity and direct detection of the inflammasome activity should improvethe accuracy of our hts systemto conclude although phenotypic screenings have been performed with various cell typesdifferentiated from human pscs the number of screenings with immune cells is still limitedour hts system provides a large number of functional monocytic lineage cells and a versatileplatform for compound screening to modify diseaseassociated phenotypes therefore it canbe used to screen candidate compounds for the treatment of congenital immunological disorders associated

fourth most common cause of death worldwide  to improve survival it is of importance to get a better insight into modifiable prognosticfactors emerging evidence suggests that vagal nerve activity indexed by heart rate variabilityhrv could be one of these prognostic factors []hrv is the physiological phenomenon of the fluctuation in time intervals between adjacentheartbeats and represents efferent vagus nerve activity to the heart [] it has been suggestedthat efferent vagal activity is inversely related with fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesisas inflammation oxidative stress and excessive sympathetic activity   these mechanisms arebelieved to be controlled by the vagus nerve via a bidirectional braintoimmune pathwaysthrough the release of neurotransmitters via the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway  a higher vagal tone may reflect a more flexible topdown regulation of the immunesystem and physiological activity moderated by the brain   absence of vagus activity due tovagotomy has been shown to increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer  in addition to influencing development of cancer vagus nerve activity seems to be a predictor of prognosis in various types of cancer recent studies show an association betweendecreased activity of the vagus nerve and worse survival in patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract liver pancreas lung prostate and breast among others   also patientswith normal hrv seem to live longer in different sorts of metastatic cancer independent ofconfounders   in patients with colorectal cancer a low hrv at baseline has shown to beassociated with higher cea levels at  months after diagnosis which predicts a poorer prognosis  in patients undergoing curative treatment for colorectal cancer hrv does not only seemto

neurotransmitters stimulating tumour metastasis and progression   it has been suggested that afferent fibres of thevagus nerve inform the brain about peripheral inflammation this is followed by a braintoimmune response via the efferent route of the vagus nerve that modulates the function ofimmuneregulatory cells through the release of neurotransmitters via the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway malfunctioning of this route may play part in the onset of cancer  this theory has been supported by studies of patients with gastric ulcers who underwent avagotomy who then showed an increased risk of developing lung and colorectal cancer [] the vagus nerve is also believed to modulate tumour progression an active vagus nervecan inhibit inflammation oxidative stress and the release of sympathetic neurotransmittersthat stimulate tumour metastasis and progression [] absence of this inhibitory effect inturn results in metastasis and tumour progression as shown in a study of erin   showingthat mice who underwent chemical vagotomy developed more metastasis of breastcancer cellsthan controls   epidemiologically low hrv has been associated with worse overall survivalover time in patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer of various types even after correctionfor confounders [] however the results of the present study do not support thesefindingsto our knowledge this is the first study including only patients with colorectal cancer whoare eligible for curative treatment by partial bowel resection and not those receiving palliativetreatment de couck   studied the relationship between hrv and tumour burden in bothcurative and palliative patients with prostate cancer or nonsmall cell lung cancer independent of confounders the hypothesised inverse relationship of hrv and the tumour markerpsa at  and  months after diagnosis was only significant in patients with stage iv prostatecancer not stage ii and iii   in colorectal cancer mouton   found that low hrv definedas sdnn   ms predicted significantly higher levels of the tumour marker cea at months after diagnosis again these results were only found in patients receiving palliativetreatment not curative   only one previous study showed a significant inverse relationshipbetween hrv and mortality in cancer in general independent of stage   this study of guo  had a large study population of  patients with various types of cancer low hrv wasdefined as sdnn  70ms and was significantly associated with shorter survival times thissuggests that hrv is a predictive indicator of survival time not only in palliative but also incurative patients however results were not controlled for cancer type which could affect bothhrv and survival and should therefore be interpreted with caution   the fact that thepatients recruited in the present sample were only with less advanced cancer may partlyexplain the lack of prognostic role in hrv in this sample one  101371 pone0237244 august     one

nerveactivity and cancer   however based on current evidence on this subject we cannot supportthis hypothesis the positive association between low hrv and worse prognosis found inpatients with colorectal cancer receiving palliative treatment but not in patients receivingcurative treatment suggest that this relation is not bidirectional but that advanced cancer isassociated with low hrv midlatestage tumours are often accompanied by damage to autonomic nerves resulting in decreased hrv   a study of de couck   showed that cancerpatients in general have a significantly lower hrv than healthy people   the same resultswere found in studies of bijoor   where rmssd was found to be significantly lower inpatients with early and advanced stage cancer compared to a healthy control group  when comparing patients with advanced stage cancer tnm iii and iv to patients with anearly stage of cancer tnm i and ii rmssd was found to be significantly lower in patientswith advanced stages of cancer   thus though experimental studies in animals showthat vagal nerve functioning can causally slow tumorigenesis the human data suggests that themalignant tumour causes vagal nerve dysfunction and therewith decreased hrv  besides the proposed influence of low hrv on survival of colorectal cancer patientsthrough development and increased progression of cancer reimer   suggested that lowhrv could influence survival of those undergoing surgical treatment due to more and moresevere postoperative complications   however the results found in this study were notconcurrent with those of reimer   who included  patients with asa   undergoingelective surgery their analysis of hrv was through powerspectrum parameters based on longer ecgrecordings instead of the timedomain parameters based on 10s ecgs used in thisstudy but the difference in used parameters used in both studies is probably not the explanation for the differences in results between both studies since it has been demonstrated thatrmssd and sdnn based on ecg recordings of 10s are in substantial agreement with those of45min and a 10s ecg therefore suffices to determine time domain hrv parameters howeverreimer   did not correct for possible confounders in their study patients with low hrvwere more likely to have diabetes a known risk factor for postoperative ileus and wound infections both found to be common postoperative complications in their low hrv group correcting for this comorbidity may change the significance of their findings   a study of one  101371 pone0237244 august     one 0chrv and prognosis

well as valid knowledge about significant determinants of both pa and piregular pa is a highly effective healthpromoting method with strong evidence [  ] international recommendations for pa are existing for all age groups [ ] but it stillremains under debate how people should accumulate their recommended time of pa over theweek  in recent years the number of interventions targeting pi has increased however there isstill a lack of recommendations for pi   in addition it is also not conclusively establishedwhether pi is an independent risk factor for chronic diseases   in summary recent literature points out that public health activities should emphasise increasing pa at any intensityespecially in the elderly  limitationsthis analysis is based on a convenience sample of participants we used a variety of samplingmethods including the possibility of selfrecruitment some of which have likely increased theproportion of participants with above average pa compared to pa at the population level weobserved high levels of pa particularly among the older age groups and females which indicate some selection biasin general the use of accelerometer devices for objective assessment of pa allows a validand reliable record of pa intensity frequency and duration but data from the accelerometerdevice can potentially differ from the real levels of pa and pi especially in the elderly becauseseveral activities are carried out in standing eg gardening or sedentary positions eg gymnastic on stools which as a consequence can not be assessed reliablyin general the explanatory value for both pa models are acceptable the explanatory valuefor our pi model is low thus research should focus on further environmental and interpersonal factors eg the walkability of neigbourhoods and

recommendations in pa and pi increases continuously however there are still certain aspects especially of pi which can not described in an accurate wayto our knowledge we still know only little about the independent negative health effects ofsedentary behavior in general there is international consensus regarding recommendationsfor pa but recommendations about pi are still under debatebecause of demographic change and the associated increase of proportion of older peoplethe need of global prevention strategies is high simultaneously knowledge to improve ourunderstanding of pa and pi in the elderly prevalence of dementia and chronic diseases egcvd will probably increase in the next decades therefore the relevance of modifiable riskfactors as preventive measures will rise  our analyses confirm that especially individual factors eg age sex has the largest impacton pa the results for pi are less clear thus pi may have other predictors another importantfinding of this study is that pa and pi can be seen as mostly independent factors of activityparticipants with a high level of pa showed also high levels of pi further research should paymore attention to effective predictors for the

health priority setting garbage codes are prevalent at all ages contrary to expectations further researchinto effective strategies deployed in these countries to improve data quality can informefforts elsewhere to improve cod reporting systemsintroductiona key source of evidence for targeting health interventions to improve population health ishigh quality cause of death cod data that reliably document trends in mortality for differentdiseases and injuries   however several studies have demonstrated that policy and practicein many countries are based on data that are far from accurate [] in order to target effortsto improve the utility of cod data for policy it is important to first understand what the keydiagnostic errors area major problem with cod data is poor cause of death certification practices that result ingarbage codes ie codes that provide little or no information about the true underlying causeof death   garbage codes include what are often called illdefined causes but encompass alarger universe of uninformative diagnoses the major consequence of garbage codes is thatthey obscure the true mortality pattern in a population for example if a death certificate onlystates septicemia as the cause of death there is no way of knowing whether this resulted forexample from an infected wound following an accident from a postoperative amputationdue to diabetes or from meningitis or pneumonia each of which would require different preventive strategies if the underlying cause that led to septicemia is not indicated on the deathcertificate public policy to prevent these deaths would be misinformed potentially leading toinefficient resource allocation to prevent themcod data provide the essential health intelligence for health policies across countries atvarious levels of socioeconomic development our premise is that a better understanding ofgarbage codes ie their levels and patterns in countries at different stages of socioeconomicdevelopment will help to target improvements in cod reporting systems in this study weinvestigate whether the usability of cod data and the patterns of garbage codes are related toa countrys socioeconomic development using the anaconda software tool [  s1 file]to assess the quality of  national cod datasets several countries have used this tool to assesshow fit for purpose their data are [] but there has not been any crosscountry analysis ofdata quality across a range of socioeconomic development levels and cod reporting systemsusing the common anaconda frameworkthe implication of our findings for public policy to improve population health is that if therelationship is found to be very weak or nonexistent then efforts to improve national civilregistration and vital statistics systems can expect to make significant progress towardsimproving the evidence base for policy without depending on further socioeconomicdevelopmentdata and methodswe carried out a crosssectional study using publicly available data from the who mortalitydatabase   which contains cod data reported by its member states the  countries one  101371 pone0237539 august     one 0care

in levels of socioeconomic development population data were taken from the un worldpopulation prospects    with the youngest age group of  years divided into  and14years age groups using spragues interpolation  we classified a countrys level of development using the socio demographic index sdiscore from the global burden of disease study gbd into three levels high middle and lowthe sdi is a summary measure of development expressed on a scale from  to  taking intoaccount the total fertility rate years of schooling and gross national income   for the lowestsdi level the who mortality database only contained the few countries we selected for themiddle and high sdi levels we selected countries with recent data from different regions of theworld our study included  low sdi countries  middle sdi and  high sdi countrieson the basis of the country specific icd10 codes used in gbd    the most severecertification and coding errors that can mislead policy and public health planning were identified and categorized into four groups the fourtier garbage code typology used in anaconda is based on the premise that some garbage codes are worse than others depending onhow serious their impact is for guiding or misguiding policy debates and will thus likely impactdisease and injury control strategies differently  ¢ level  very highcodes with serious policy implications these are causes for which thetrue underlying cod could in fact belong to any of three broad cause group ie it is impossible to establish whether the true cause was a communicable disease a noncommunicabledisease or because of an injury a good example being septicaemia reported as the underlying cause of death these are the most serious misdiagnoses among the universe of unusable codes since they could potentially grossly misinform understanding of the extent ofepidemiological transition in the population¢ level  highcodes with substantial implications for policy these are causes for whichthe true underlying cod is likely to belong to one or two of the three broad cause groupsfor example essential primary hypertension¢ level  mediumcodes with important implications for policy these are causes forwhich the true underlying cod is likely to be within the same icd chapter for exampleunspecified cancer and thus are of some policy value¢ level  lowcodes with limited implications for policy these are diagnoses for whichthe true underlying cod is likely to be confined to a single disease or injury category egunspecified stroke would still be assigned as a stroke death and not to some other diseasecategory the implications of unusable causes classified at this level will therefore be muchless important for public policy but a more specific code would have increased their utilityfor specific public health analysesa full list of the composition of specific icd10 garbage codes for each of the four severitylevels is given in s2 filegiven the considerable differences in population age structure between countries at highand low levels of socioeconomic development we age standardised the pattern of garbagecodes the point of agestandardising was to investigate whether countries with a comparatively old age structure and hence relatively high average age at death might expect to have agreater fraction of garbage codes simply because of the higher likelihood of multiple comorbidity in the elderly we used the global age distribution of deaths from the latest gbd studyas the standard   one  101371 pone0237539 august     one 0care cause of death data fit for purposein addition to diagnostic accuracy the ability of any dataset to describe the true mortalitypattern in a population also depends on how complete it is both in terms of capturing alldeaths that occur and in assigning each a cod completeness of the cod reporting ie thepercentage of actual deaths in a population that are assigned a cod for each of the  countries was calculated using the adairlopez empirical method incorporated into anaconda  the empirical method models the relationship between the crude death rate cdr andits principal determinants namely the age structure of the population and the overall level ofmortality as reflected by the level of child mortality the predicted cdr based on these inputvariables for a population is then compared with the observed cdr to estimate death registration completeness given that the model was built largely from historical data where the levelsof adult mortality and child mortality are closely correlated the predictions of completenessfor populations where this assumption is not valid such as those severely affected by hivshould be interpreted cautiouslydatasets that are both incomplete and have a high proportion of garbage codes provide limited insight into the true health status of a population we combined the proportion of unrecorded deaths with the amount of garbage codes to provide a summary measure of the utilityof the data for policy this indicator is particularly important when investigating data qualityin countries with low completeness where the data available may only come from hospitalsand other health facilities where diagnostic facilities and physician availability is greaterpotentially overstating the policy utility of the dataa key output of any mortality surveillance system is a table showing the leading causes ofdeath for the population in countries where garbage codes are commonly assigned they frequently appear among the  or  leading causes and can seriously impact the overall utilityof the cod data this is particularly the case when they permeate the top  leading causesand are high impact providing little or no useful information for policythe anaconda software tool specifically developed for assessing quality of mortalityand cod data was used to investigate each dataset s1 file to identify the pattern and extentof garbage codes in the data their frequency among the leading causes the completeness ofthe dataset and to provide an overall summary index of the quality of the output of the mortality data system namely the vital statistics performance index for quality vspiq  resultsthe proportion of garbage codes in the  country datasets varied substantially by countryranging from  to  see fig  while the relationship between sdi and amount of garbage codes in the data is broadly apparent the relatively low r2  arises from the presenceof outliers particularly uzbekistan kyrgyzstan nicaragua and colombia it is quite possiblethat specific certification and coding procedures have been introduced in these countries toavoid the use of garbage codes if these countries are omitted the strength of the inverse relationship is much more apparent further insights into the general characteristics of populationand mortality of the selected countries can be found in s2 filethe mean values for each sdi group indicate that on average countries of high sdi statushad a lower  proportion of garbage codes in their data than middle  and low sdi countries table  interestingly there was large intercountry variation in theuse of garbage codes within each sdi level for example of the high sdi countries finlandhad the lowest amount of garbage codes  in their data whereas in japan  and france the level was five times higher affecting about one in three

access should be considered alongside intravenous therapy for hydration inolder adults and several medications there are additional benefits in terms of ease of useand costeffectiveness of this mode inclusion of subcutaneous access in clinical guidelinesmay promote uptake of this route to help preserve vessel health of vulnerable patients further highquality research is needed to inform subcutaneous infusion therapy in a variety ofpopulations including pediatrics and palliative care and medications and clarifying themechanism of deliveryintroductioninfusion therapy is a common treatment modality to deliver medications and fluids in theacute and home care settings and is gaining prevalence in the longterm care setting traditionally these parenteral therapies have been delivered via the intravenous route howevervenous depletion is a growing concern with an increasing aging population and patients withlongterm complex comorbidities [] the problems of venous depletion are compoundedby unnecessary peripheral venipuncture which add to patient physical and psychologicaltrauma compromised intravenousrelated outcomes suboptimal use of healthcare resourcesand increased costs [ ] additionally infusion therapy is moving beyond the boundariesof the acute care and home care sector to hospices and longterm care facilities   recentlypublished vascular access planning tools are either oriented primarily to the acute care settingor do not address the option of subcutaneous access [ ]the infusion therapy standards of practice recommend consideration of subcutaneousaccess for the administration of isotonic solutions and for continuous opioid and other infusion therapiesmedications eg immunoglobulin therapy   subcutaneous access isachieved through the placement of a small catheter in the subcutaneous tissue with the infusate absorbed from this space into the circulatory system this route has the advantages ofrequiring a small catheter and less technical insertion skills than that used for intravenousaccess with its ease of application lending to its use in multiple settings   additionallytime to place the catheter is less and fewer complications are likely resulting in cost benefits[ ] although practiced since  there has been a slow uptake in part due to a lack offamiliarity with the technique among physicians and healthcare professionals and perceivedsuboptimal outcomes eg hypovolemic shock due to inappropriate use of hydration solutions [ ] in our scoping literature search to prepare for a systematic review of primarystudies numerous systematic reviews were identified however each either had a narrowscope addressing one treatment eg fisher and colleagues review of iron overload management   or provided limited literature search or limited evidence eg duemsnoreiga andblascos   review of subcutaneous fluid and drug deliverygiven the worlds aging population health care systems rapidly changing diversity in practice setting and complexity of care and patient health conditions the uptake and use of subcutaneous continuous infusions may help address these issues and challenges the aim of ourstudy is to determine the effectiveness safety acceptability and efficiency related to the use ofsubcutaneous infusion sci as an alternate route to intravenous for the management of conditions or

7561,Colon_Cancer,tenascinc tnc is an extracellular matrix ecm glycoprotein that plays an important rolein cell proliferation migration and tumour invasion in various cancers tnc is one of themain protein overexpressed in breast cancer indicating a role for this ecm molecule in cancer pathology in this study we have evaluated the tnc lossofffunction in breast cancercells in our approach we used dsrna sharing sequence homology with tnc mrna calledatnrna we present the data showing the effects of atnrna in mdamb231 cells bothin monolayer and threedimensional culture cells treated with atnrna were analyzed forphenotypic alterations in proliferation migration adhesion cell cycle multicaspase activation and the involvement in epithelial to mesenchymal transition emt processes as complementary analysis the oncogenomic portals were used to assess the clinical implication oftnc expression on breast cancer patients survival showing the tnc overexpression associated with a poor survival outcome our approach applied first in brain tumors and then inbreast cancer cell lines reveals that atnrna significantly diminishes the cell proliferationmigration and additionally reverses the mesenchymal cells phenotype to the epithelial onethus tnc could be considered as the universal target in different types of tumors wheretnc overexpression is associated with poor prognosisa1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111open accesscitation wawrzyniak d grabowska m gÅodowiczp kuczyÅski k kuczyÅska b fedorukwyszomirska a    downregulation oftenascinc

authors have declaredthat no competing interests existthe tumor microenvironment is composed of the surrounding stromal cells such as endothelialcells in blood vessels immune cells fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix ecm [ ] during carcinogenesis is often perturbed and deregulated while during embryonic development isstrictly controlled to maintain homeostasis   in tumors the composition of the ecm differsfrom that of normal tissue and enables new interactions that affect the function of cancer cellsand are critical in modulating invasion associated with cell migration and growth the tumorassociated ecm presents several tumorassociated antigens that are generally more abundant one  101371 pone0237889 august     one 0cdownregulation of tenascinc inhibits breast cancer cells developmentand possibly more stable than those of the cell surface [] consequently these proteins represent possible valuable targets for tumor imaging and therapy [ ] ecm proteins such as fibronectin fn and tenascin have isoforms that are expressed in a tissue specific manner generatedby alternative splicing of their primary transcripts one of the most consistent isoform changesin the ecm of many tumors is the upregulation of the glycoprotein tenascinc tnc tncalongside tenascinx tnx tenascinr tnr and tenascinw tnn are members of wellconserved among vertebrates tenascin family tn [] numerous isoforms of tnc can beproduced through alternative splicing of nine fibronectin type iii regions between repeats  and at the premrna level there is a considerable amount of literature on the contribution of different splicingdependent tnc domains in specific biological functions   changes in thetnc isoforms expression pattern have been then described in a number of malignancies andtheir nature appears to be tumortype specific recent studies have demonstrated that somesplice variants are specific to diseased tissues [] in breast tissues expression of two tncvariants one containing domain d and the other both b and d was found to be associated withinvasive phenotype   tnc promotes cell migration angiogenesis inhibit focal contact formation and also act as a cell survival factor [] its importance was found in the development and progression of different types of neoplasm including colon and breast cancerfibrosarcoma lung cancer melanoma squamous cell carcinoma bladder cancer and prostaticadenocarcinoma [ ] tnc is also highly expressed in highgrade gliomas which correlatesas well with the invasiveness of glioma cells [] in the brain it is important for the development of neural stem cells [ ] and moreover is suspected to be a potential marker for glioblastoma multiforme gbm stem cells gsc  previously we have shown that tnc is overexpressed in gbm and can be a good target inrnai approach with 164nt long dsrna complementary to the mrna of tnc which wecalled atnrna we conducted the experimental therapy for gbm patients   the discoverythat tnc presents a dominant epitope in glioblastoma prompted us to investigate the potentialof atnrna to block the tnc expression and its effect on the growth of human breast cancers where tnc overexpression was also established and linked with the highest malignancyinvasion capability and metastasis ability this view is supported by mock   who showedthat gbm patients with antibodies against the egflike repeats of tnc antibody targetvcedgftgpdcae have a significantly better prognosis than other patients   thus weassumed that in the light of the satisfactory results of brain tumors experimental therapy breastcancer could be the next possible object of interest to establish the atnrna approachhere we demonstrate that atnrna approach can be successfully used in breast cancercells impairing the basic hallmarks of tumor cells with the performed analysis of proliferation migration rate multicaspases induction pathway cell cycle analysis spheroids viabilityand the involvement of tnc in emt induction we have then interrogated the impact of tncon breast cancer growth showing its potency to be also the promising therapeutic target inbreast cancer treatmentresultsoncogenomic in

involvement of tnc in cell adhesive properties targeting the tnc in potential therapymight be also highly beneficial since it has been already established that tnc maintain a stemcell niche in the

pure tenascinc substratum results in g1phase arrest by inactivation of the cdk2 complex in a ckidependent manner   in contrast to fibroblasts proliferation of most tumor cells is stimulated by tnc  this shows that the effect of tnc on proliferation is cell typespecific and suggests that in cancer cells the cdk2 complex is not repressed in the presence of tnc in leukemia breast carcinoma and glioma were found subpopulations of stemlike cells that support tumor growth  in such cells adhesion on the tnc substratum may override the g0g1 and gls cellcycle checkpoints which may explain the

treatment of these cells with the pparÎ agonist tginduced the expression of pparÎ as well as gata3 but not foxa1 in mortal human urothelial cells treatment with the pparÎ agonist shows an increase in the expression of the transcription factor foxa1   and this is contrary to what is seen in our study these differencescould be due to the cell type since we are using immortalized cells the as3transformedurotsa cells showed an induction in the expression of pparÎ and foxa1 when treated withtg however the expression of gata3 in these transformed lines was not consistent in bccell lines studies by others have shown that have shown that gata3 and foxa1 cooperatewith pparÎ activation to drive the differentiation of a basal bladder cancer subtype to a moredifferentiated luminal subtype   other studies have also linked the expression of foxa1 tothe development of the luminal subtype of urothelial cancer [] in our studies treatmentwith tg did result in the differentiation of the as3transformed cells based upon morphological changes and induced the expression of pparÎ as well as foxa1 both of which are factorsknown to drive luminal differentiation of bladder cancer cell linessignaling via the pparÎ pathway is essential for the growth arrest and terminal differentiation of adipocytes   and other normal epithelial [] and cancer cells [] whereassignaling via the egfr receptor plays a role in cell proliferation the keratins play an essentialrole in the differentiation of epithelial cells and different keratin profiles are expressed at different stages of differentiation the normal bladder has three different stages of differentiationand these stages are marked by the expression of krt14 krt5 and krt20   krt14 isexpressed in a subset of basal cells

the most differentiated cells theumbrella cells   these differentiation stages of the bladder are shared by bladder cancersand malignant transformation can occur in any of the different cell types of the bladder theexpression of krt14 is seen in the least of the differentiated tumors and its expression correlates to poor prognosis krt14   whereas the expression of krt20 is restricted to differentiated bladder cancers and its expression is associated with good prognosis   a study doneby varley     showed that normal human urothelial cells in culture express krt14 andlack the expression of krt13 and krt20 activation of pparÎ in these cells induced theexpression of krt13 and decreased the expression of krt14 this effect was significantlyenhanced when

beensufficiently investigated our study found that egfr mutations were also present in conjunctival scc in east asians however we did not obtain results that correlated with the final prognosis further studies including further multiinstitutional studies and an increase in thenumber of cases will be needed in the future another limitation is that double testing of formalinfixed paraffinembedded specimens and plasma with realtime pcr for detection ofegfr mutations is more common than ihc in actual clinical practice according to the literature both the sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for these two types of mutations  in addition the size of our study cohort was small n   and the length of followup lessthan  year in some patients may not have been sufficient for longterm outcome analysestherefore additional studies will be needed to corroborate our findingsin  the results of this study indicate that egfr is an active molecular target inthe pathology of ossn including scc and is a prognostic factor the finding also suggests thatdiscovery of mutations may have important implications for future treatment optionssupporting informations1

7564,Colon_Cancer,"""peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorsppars asligandactivated transcription factors belong to the steroidreceptor superfamily which includes three isoforms pparalpha ppar betadelta and ppar gamma   ppars formheterodimers with retinoic x receptors and regulate theexpression of various genes upon ligand binding ppars alsointeract with corepressors or coactivators to modulate thetranscription of its downstream target genes ppars asimportant transcriptional regulators have been suggested tobe involved in lipid metabolism and multiple cellular functions for instance ppar alpha also functions in fatty acidbetaoxidation and vascular ammation   ppar gammaacts as a regulator in adipocyte diï¬erentiation and type  diabetes   ppar betadelta is a key player in cardiac energyproduction angiogenesis and particularly in cancer progression  ppar alpha and ppar gamma exert predominantly anantiangiogenic eï¬ect [] but there still exist conï¬ictingstudies showing opposite results [ ] on the contraryppar betadelta produces more obviously proangiogeniceï¬ects [] in this review we will focus on the promotingrole of ppar betadelta in angiogenesis especially in tumorangiogenesis the network of interplay between ppar betadelta and its various downstream signal molecules and alsobetween those key molecules will be further discussed andestablished remarkably diverse important signal moleculesinvolved in tumor angiogenesis and progression and cancercell metabolism have been identiï¬ed as direct ppar betadelta target genes angiogenesisangiogenesis is the physiological process through which anew capillary network forms from the preexisting vasculature[ ] whereas vasculogenesis denotes de novo bloodvessel formation mostly during embryogenesis in whichendothelial progenitor cells epc migrate to sites of vascularization then diï¬erentiate into endothelial cells ec andcoalesce into the initial vascular plexus [ ] besides theinteraction between proangiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors angiogenesis is also a multiple step biologicalprocess during which a variety of molecules cooperateincluding cell adhesion molecules matrix metalloproteinases 0cppar researchmmps extracellular matrix ecm and basement membrane componentsangiogenesis is a physiological and vital process in development and growth an imbalance of proangiogenic andantiangiogenic factors causes angiogenesis in pathologicalconditions such as diabetic retinopathy and tumor growththus when the imbalance comes to a point at which angiogenesis is triggered by tumor cells then an angiogenicswitch of tumor cells is turned on during tumor progression the angiogenic switch is often activated and remainson [] inducing angiogenesis is known as a hallmarkof cancer   and angiogenesis is also a fundamental stepby which most benign tumors transition into malignant ones tumor angiogenesis tumor needs to sprout new vesselsand further develop a vascular network in order to supplynutrients and oxygen remove waste products support a continually high proliferative rate and ultimately expand neoplastic growth [ ] hence angiogenesis is essential forhelping sustain tumor growth and facilitate tumor progression besides being a requirement for angiogenesis an abnormal vasculature also helps to promote tumor progression andmetastasis the tumor vascular wall is imperfect and prone toleakage so it is much easier for tumor cells to directly penetrate into the blood vessels or lymphatic vessels and then proliferate at another distant site to form metastasis  due to intensive abnormal neovascularization in tumortissues most malignant tumors grow rapidly and acquirethe ability to spread to adjacent and distant ans whichmakes them more malignant and even life threateningtherefore angiogenesis indeed plays an important role intumor progression and metastasis and to intervene with thisprocess would obviously prevent tumor development andspread thus this has been regarded as a critical target forantitumor therapy ppar alpha and angiogenesisit was reported ï¬rstly that a selective ppar alpha agonistwy14643 did not show any eï¬ect on angiogenesis or ec proliferation   but some subsequent studies showed that theactivation of ppar alpha inhibited angiogenesis in vitro byusing fenoï¬brate a clinically used ppar alpha agonist  moreover fenoï¬brate suppressed ec proliferation migration and tube formation through inhibition of protein kinaseb akt and disruption of the cytoskeleton   furthermore ppar alpha activation was shown to inhibit vascularendothelial growth factor vegf induced ec migrationand basic ï¬broblast growth factor bfgffgf2 inducedcorneal angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo   especiallyin vivo reduced tumor growth and microvessel numberswere observed in mice implanted with melanoma lewis lungcarcinoma llc ï¬brosarcoma and glioblastoma due to asystemic treatment of ppar alpha ligand and the antiangiogenic state induced through activation of ppar alpha withelevated thrombospondin1 tsp1 and endostatin expression  howeverit was demonstrated inanother observation that activation of ppar alpha stimuin that same yearlated neovascularization in vivo with increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos and akt via avegfdependent manner   furthermore zhang andward also suggested that ppar alpha activation inducedproangiogenic responses in human ocular cells   inanother study it was shown that a new ppar alpha agonistrk13675 had no eï¬ect on angiogenesis   recentlyppar alpha activation is further shown to have antineovascularization eï¬ects with downregulation of vegf and angiopoietin expression in a rat alkali burn model  in summary the role of ppar alpha in angiogenesis isstill controversial some observations showed that ligandactivation of ppar alpha had antiangiogenic eï¬ects mediated either through upregulation of antiangiogenic factorssuch as tsp1 and endostatin or downregulation of proangiogenic factors including vegf fgf2 akt and angiopoietins others also reported opposite results showing aproangiogenic role upon ppar alpha activation thus thespeciï¬c molecular mechanism is still unclear and needs tobe further studied ppar gamma and angiogenesisligand activation of ppar gamma was previously shown toinhibit human umbilical vein endothelial cell huvec tubeformation in collagen gels   and vegfinduced choroidalneovascularization in vitro and in vivo   another studyalso demonstrated that ec apoptosis was induced throughtreatment with the ppar gamma ligand 15dpgj2   furthermore rosiglitazone a potent ppar gamma agonist wasshown to inhibit primary tumor growth and metastasisthrough both direct and indirect antiangiogenic eï¬ectsin vitro and bfgfinduced corneal neovascularizationin vivo   moreover a similar observation also displayedthe inhibition of vegfinduced angiogenesis in a chickchorioallantonic membrane model   in a mouse modelwith ischemiainduced retinopathy pioglitazone a ppargamma agonist also showed a protective eï¬ect against pathological neoangiogenesis through upregulation of antiammatory adipokine

layers and an altered placental microvasculature were observed in pregnant wildtype mice treatedwith the ppar gamma agonist rosiglitazone as well asreduced expression of proangiogenic factorsincludingvegf proliferin and plateletendothelial cell adhesionmolecule1 pecam1cd31   suggesting a crucial roleof ppar gamma in placental vascular development the 0cppar researchmajor antiangiogenic properties on ppar gamma activationwere also reviewed here  notablyin most cancersthe canonical wntbetacatenin pathway is upregulated while on the contrary ppargamma is downregulated interestingly in numerous tissuesthe activation of ppar gamma inhibits the betacateninpathway whereascanonicalwntbetacatenin signal cascade also inactivates ppargamma   implicating a negative regulatory role of ppargamma in carcinogenesis where tumor angiogenesis mightbe a fundamental stepstimulation ofthethein summary ppar gamma predominantly displays anantiangiogenic eï¬ect that may be mediated through the inhibition of vegf or bfgfinduced neovascularization andreduction of the expression level of some proangiogenicfactors ppar betadelta and angiogenesisunlike ppar alpha and ppar gamma on the contrarymany studies have explicitly shown the proangiogenic eï¬ectsof ppar betadelta on physiological and pathological angiogenesis the ï¬rst evidence provided in a study is that activation of ppar betadelta with gw501516 a highly selectiveppar betadelta agonistinduces huvec proliferationand an increased expression of vegf and its receptorvegfr1 flt1   besides inducing ec proliferationppar betadelta activation by itsligand prostacyclinpgi2 also stimulates upregulation of  alpha expression an antiapoptotic and antiammatory protein whichthereby protects ecs from h2o2induced apoptosis and oxidant injury   moreover a subsequent study further provides evidence that activation of ppar betadelta withgw501516 induces angiogenesis during which vegfrelease is considered as a major trigger factor   ï¬rstlysuggesting the promotion for angiogenesis upon pparbetadelta activationmÃ¼llerbrÃ¼sselbach   show that ppar betadelta mice implanted with llc and b16 melanoma exhibit diminished blood ï¬ow and immature microvascular structurescompared with wildtype mice moreover reexpression ofppar betadelta into the matrigelinvading cells triggersmicrovessel maturation and restores normal vascularization  indicating a crucial role of ppar betadelta in tumorvascularization additionally another study also observedreduced levels of calcium intracellular channel protein clic4 but it observed enhanced expression of cellular retinol binding protein  crbp1 in migrating ecs from pparbetadeltanull mice   both of which play a role in tumorvascularization [ ] it was reported that ppar betadeltawas required for placentation   and most of the pparbetadeltanull mutant embryos died at e95 to e105 due toabnormal celltocell communication atthe placentaldecidual interface   however in these studies [] adefect in angiogenesis was not observed during normal development in ppar betadeltaknockout micesome observations also show the important role of pparbetadelta in physiological angiogenesis for instance skeletal musclespeciï¬c ppar betadelta overexpression leads toppar betadeltaan increase in the number of oxidative muscle ï¬bers andrunning endurance in adult mice [] moreover pparbetadelta activation promotes a rapid muscle remodelingvia a calcineurindependent manner and induces muscleangiogenesis in highly selective ppar betadelta agonistgw0742treated animals   furthermore in the heartpharmacologicalstimulation withgw0742 induces rapid cardiac growth and cardiac angiogenesis through direct transcriptional activation of calcineurin   interestingly the same cardiac phenotype wasalso observed after treatment with the ppar betadelta agonist gw501516implicating a response speciï¬city forppar betadelta stimulation   calcineurin activationfurther leads to the stimulation of nuclear factoractivatedt cell c3 nfatc3 and an enhanced expression of hypoxiainducible factor  alpha hif1alpha and cyclindependentkinase  cdk9   overall the remodeling in skeletalmuscle and heart is perfectly the same as the phenotypeobserved with exercise and both of them are mediatedthrough activation of calcineurinppar betadelta may act as a key regulator in mediatingpathological angiogenesis for instance ppar betadelta wasshown to regulate retinal angiogenesis in vitro and in vivoand its inhibition reduced preretinal neovascularization possibly via an angiopoietinlike protein  angptl4 dependent manner  implicating the potential of pparbetadelta in modulating pathological ocular angiogenesisrecently an observation reported that ppar betadeltaknockdown in both retinal pigment epithelial and choroidalendothelial cells caused an antiangiogenic phenotype andppar betadelta promoted laserinduced choroidal neovascular cnv lesions in ppar betadelta  mice   moreover pharmacological inhibition of ppar betadelta with theantagonist gsk0660 also resulted in a signiï¬cantly decreasedcnv lesion size in vivo suggesting a functional role of pparbetadelta in the development of cnv lesions   this indicates that ppar betadelta has an important association withpathological angiogenesisangiotensin ii ang ii the biologically

ppar betadelta activation withgw501516 induced epc proliferation and tube formationwhereas epc treated with an inhibitor of cyclooxygenasecox or pgi2 synthase or with ppar betadeltaspeciï¬csirna also displayed an opposite eï¬ect   furthermoreit has been demonstrated that ppar betadelta inducesangiogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration throughmatrix metalloproteinase mmp 9mediated insulinlikegrowth factor1 paracrine networks upon epc activation  han   also observed that ppar betadelta activationpromoted a rapid wound healing with enhanced angiogenesis in a mouse model with skin punch wound   overallin addition to ec ppar betadelta is also a key regulator ofepc or even may act as an initiator of activation of epc tofurther induce vasculogenesis ppar betadelta and tumor angiogenesislinked to tumor microenvironmentppar betadelta expression is often upregulated and promotes cancer progression in many major human cancerslung breast and gastric cancers []such as colonwhich suggests a crucial role of ppar betadelta in cancercells even though there exist some conï¬icting studies indicating that the functional role of ppar betadelta in tumorigenesis or carcinogenesis still remains highly controversial [] and dependent on speciï¬c tumor or cancer cell typesthus here we discuss the promotion of ppar betadelta intumor progression through facilitating tumor angiogenesisppar betadelta has been suggested as a critical hubnode transcriptional factor which governs a tumor angiogenic switch [ ] in the transcriptional networkanalysis it was reported that tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis were markedly inhibited in ppar betadeltanullmice in comparison with wildtype mice   moreoverthe elevated ppar betadelta expression level was also considered to be highly correlated to pathologically advancedtumor stage and increased cancer risk for recurrence and distant metastasis in patients with pancreatic cancer   indicating the crucial association of ppar betadelta withtumor angiogenesis progression and cancer invasivenessppar betadelta may indirectly facilitate tumor angiogenesis and progression through its function on the tumormicroenvironment tme where tumor angiogenesis is fostered moreover a tumor also releases some extracellular signals to closely communicate and constantly collaborate withtme to facilitate tumor angiogenesis in order to furtherenable tumor growth and progression for instance it wasshown that colon cancer cells with ppar betadelta knockoutfailed to stimulate ec vascularization in response to hypoxicstress whereas wildtype cells exposed to hypoxia were ableto induce angiogenesis [ ] suggesting that ppar betadelta is required for the promotion of angiogenesis in hypoxic stressmediated tme moreover in the tme tumorltrating myeloid cells are considered as the most important cells for fostering tumor angiogenesis among the multiple diï¬erent kinds of stromal cells   besides stimulatingtumor angiogenesis tumor myeloid cells also support tumrowth by suppressing tumor immunity and promotingtumor metastasis to distinct sites   interestingly it hasbeen demonstrated that ppar betadelta activation intumorltrating myeloid cells stimulates cancer cell invasion and facilitates tumor angiogenesis via an interleukin il10 dependent manner   moreover impairedtumor growth and angiogenesis were observed in pparbetadelta ko bmt mice due to ppar betadelta deï¬ciencyin tumor myeloid cells   suggesting that ppar betadeltaplays a key role in tumor angiogenesis and progression intumor myeloid cells of tmefurthermore the endoplasmic reticulum er an essential anelle involved in many cellular functions is implicated in tme in cancer stressors like hypoxia nutrientdeprivation and acidosis disrupt er function and lead toaccumulation of unfolded proteins in er a condition knownas er stress cells adapt to er stress by activating an integrated signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response upr upr represents a survival response bythe cells to restore er homeostasis and has both survivaland cell death eï¬ects the mechanisms that determine cellfate during er stress are not well understood for instanceshort exposure to er stress initially increases akt signalingbut longterm er stress suppresses akt signaling  ppar betadelta activation has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum er stressassociated ammation inskeletal muscle through an ampkdependent mechanism  and to reduce ammation in response to chronic erstress in cardiac cells   furthermore it has been nicelyshown that ppar betadelta can repress rasoncogeneinduced er stress to promote senescence in tumors   thisis mediated through the decrease of pakt activity promoting cellular senescence through upregulation of p53 and p27expression   it would be interesting to investigate thedirect eï¬ects of ppar betadelta on senescence of tumorendothelial cells in an in vivo setting we recently showedthat senescent endothelial cells are indispensable for ahealthy lifespan and that removal of senescent endotheliumdisrupts vascular function leading to diminished vessel densities and ï¬brotic lesions   if ppar betadelta mediatessenescence of tumor endothelium thereby protecting vesselintegrity this might explain the enhanced tumor growthand vascularization upon ppar betadelta activationobserved by us and others [  ]most recently zuo   demonstrated that pparbetadelta in cancer cells regulates tumor angiogenesisin vivo and in vitro by promoting the secretion of proangiogenic factors including vegf and interleukin  il8  most importantly in our recent works it has beenshown that conditionalinducible vascular endotheliumspeciï¬c ppar betadelta overexpression in vivo leads to 0cppar researchenhanced tumor angiogenesis tumor growth and metastasis formationfurther indicating a vascular ecspeciï¬cppar betadelta action mechanism in tumor progressionindependent of some controversial observations of pparbetadelta in speciï¬c tumor or cancer cell types   wagner   also ï¬rstly reported the mouse model in whichrapid induction of cardiac angiogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy were observed [ ] crosstalk between ppar betadelta and signalmolecules ppar betadelta activation or overexpressionmay upregulate the expression of its various downstream signal molecules involved in tumor angiogenesis includingproangiogenic factors such as vegf pdgf and fgfproinvasive matrixdegrading enzymes such as mmp9proammatory mediators such as cox2 and cytokinesand chemokines such as il1 and cxcl8 even some ofwhich have been further identiï¬ed as ppar betadelta directtarget genes besides a leading role of ppar betadelta amongthe signal molecules ppar betadelta may function in tmelinked to diverse kinds of cells through direct or indirectmodulation of its downstream molecules interplay between ppar betadelta and ammatoryangiogenesis ammatory angiogenesis is a crucial processin tumor progression for instance the proammatorymediator cyclooxygenase2 cox2 is considered as a keyregulator of angiogenesis and tumor growth through multiple downstream proangiogenic mechanisms such as production of vegf and induction of mmps moreover selectiveinhibition of cox2 has also been shown to suppress angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro   it is well known that vegfaplays a critical role in both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis  and it leads the directional migration of tip cells andstalk cell proliferation in microtubule branches [ ] ithas also been demonstrated that mmp9 triggers the angiogenic switch during carcinogenesis and enhances the availability of vegf to its receptors   furthermore it hasbeen reported that ammatory cell mmp9 initiates theonset of tumor neovascularization during which there existsfunctionalincludingmmp9   leptin is shown to mediate angiogenesisin vivo and in vitro through induction of ec proliferationand expression of mmp2 and mmp9   and to furtherpromote ec diï¬erentiation and directional migrationthrough enhancement of cox2 activity   leptin couldalso induce angiogenesis via transactivation of vegfr inecs   additionally besides inducing angiogenesisppar betadelta also functions in chronic ammationfacilitating tumorigenesis through induction of cox2 andits product prostaglandin e2 pge2 in vivo [ ]interestingly cox2 vegf mmp9 and leptin have beenidentiï¬ed as ppar betadelta target genes via a direct transcriptional activation mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells   colorectal cancer cells [ ] epcs[ ] and liposarcoma cells   respectivelylinks between vegf and mmpsin tme tumorltrating ammatory cells also helpto induce and sustain tumor angiogenesis and further tofacilitate tissue invasion and tumor metastatic spread byreleasing some signal molecules such as proinvasive mmp9and ammatory chemokines [] chemotaxis is alsoa crucial process for inducing angiogenesis in tumors eitherdirectly by attracting ecs towards tumor cells to form newvessels or indirectly by mediating immune ammatorycells to ltrate eventually promoting tumor angiogenesis  chemotaxis of tumor cells and stromal cells in tmeis also required for tumor dissemination during tumor progression and metastasis [ ]cxc chemokines such as cxcl8 encoding il8 andcxcl5 are also involved in cox2associated angiogenesisto contribute to nonsmallcelllung cancer progression[ ] it is further shown that il8 directly regulatesangiogenesis via recruitment of neutrophils   whichfurther drives vegf activation   moreoveril8responding neutrophils are considered as the major sourceof angiogenesisinducing mmp9 [ ] chemokine cc motif ligand  ccl2 in addition to the promotionof angiogenesis [ ] also enhances tumor

proangiogenic factorssuch as vegf cxcl8plateletderived growth factor pdgf and transforminggrowth factor beta tgf beta [] in fact bothtgf beta and hypoxia are potentinducers of vegfexpression in tumor cells and collaborate with tme toprovide the foundation of tumor angiogenesis and cancercell invasion   importantly il8 has been reported asa key target gene of ppar betadelta to promote angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro   and ccl2 expression isalso signiï¬cantly upregulated upon vascular ppar betadelta overexpression in vivo  suppressorcellscox2 also mediates il1 betainduced angiogenesisin vitro and in vivo [ ] il1 beta supports neovascularization through the regulation of the expression of vegfand its receptor vegfr2 flk1kdr on ecs   il1 actsas an upstream proammatory mediator that initiates anddisseminates the ammatory state by inducing a localinteractive network and increasing adhesion moleculeexpression on ecs and leukocytes which facilitates tumorassociated angiogenesis   in tme ammatory il1beta recruits myeloid cells from bone marrow and activatesthem to produce proangiogenic factors such as vegf vegffurther activates ecs and myeloid cells promoting tumorinvasiveness and fostering tumor angiogenesis   in addition il6 also stimulates angiogenesis and vasculogenesis[ ] however gopinathan   observed an il6induced newly forming vascular structure with defectivepericyte pc coverage ex vivo   thus facilitating cancercell ltration and tumor metastasis through vascular leakage interestingly il1 and il6 expression levels are signiï¬cantly upregulated in the ppar betadelta overexpressionmouse model reported recently  in summary ppar betadelta seems to act as a key leaderin ammatory mediatordriven tumor angiogenesis linkedto tme in which many proammatory mediators chemokines and proangiogenic factors closely communicate with 0cppar researcheach other and also associate with tumorltrating myeloid cells such as neutrophils tams and mdscs

leukemia oncogene ets1 also plays a key role in regulating vascular development and haemopoiesis particularly in angiogenesis  in addition ets1 promotes cancer cell invasion throughupregulation of

human cancerassociatedï¬broblasts cafs [ ] cafs support tumor growthby secreting growth factors such as vegf fgf pdgf andchemokines to stimulate angiogenesis and thereby promotecancer cell invasion and metastasis formation [ ]cafs as metastatic tumor stroma are a crucial componentin tumor progression through the remodeling of the ecmstructure thus helping a tumor to acquire an aggressive phenotype [ ] ppar betadelta in cafs also exhibits aprotumorigenic eï¬ect it was reported that ablation of pparbetadelta in cafs attenuated tumor growth by altering theredox balance in tme   suggesting that ppar betadeltain cafs is also an important player in tumor developmentets1 induces the expression of vegf vegfr1 andvegfr2 in ecs [] in turn vegf is also a majorinducer of ets1 in ecs through the activation of either thepi3kakt pathway or the mekerk12 signal cascade[ ] wt1 is also reported to regulate tumor angiogenesis via direct transactivation of ets1  sryrelated hmgbox  sox18 has also beenreported previously to induce angiogenesis during tissuerepair and wound healing   and cancer progression  and most recently it was further shown that speciï¬cecderived endovascular progenitors initiated a vasculogenic process and diï¬erentiated into more mature endothelial phenotypes within the core of the growing tumorsthrough reactivation of sox18   interestingly theseimportant proangiogenic molecules including wt1 ets1and sox18 are also signiï¬cantly upregulated in the vascularppar betadelta overexpression model in vivo   andwt1 is also identiï¬ed as a target gene of ppar betadeltain melanoma cells   ppar betadelta may facilitate cancer progression atdiverse cellular levels in tme ppar betadelta activationis shown to induce colonic cancer stem cell csc expansionand to promote the liver metastasis of colorectal cancerin vivo via direct transactivation of the nanog gene  nanog as a key transcriptional factor governs the selfrenewal and pluripotency of stem cells   and cancer cellsexpressing nanog also often exhibit stem cell properties  protooncogene ckitcd117 is known as the maststem cell factor receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase andits activation in cscs may regulate the stemness to controltumor progression and drug resistance to tyrosine kinaseinhibitors moreover ckit has been identiï¬ed as a potentialmarker of the cancer stemlike cells   in addition ckitnot only functions on ecs [ ] but also belongs to thetumor angiogenesispromoting molecule [] studiesalso suggested that activation of ckit enhances the expression of vegf that can be suppressed by imatinib an inhibitor of ckit in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells whichthereby has an impact on tumor angiogenesis [ ] ckit is also involved in pathological ocular neovascularization   and is regulated transcriptionally by wt1  and ppar betadelta  pdgfb and its receptor pdgfr beta also known asangiogenic factors are suggested to enhance angiogenesisand vasculogenesis via their function in ecs [] andepcs   and to regulate vascular permeability and vesselmaturation through recruitment of pericytes pcs   and smooth muscle cells smcs   in newly formingvessels moreover pdgfb and pdgfr beta also interactwith other proangiogenic factors such as fgf2 [ ]vegfa and its receptor vegfr2   furthermorepdgfb and pdgfr beta may also aï¬ect cancer growthand progression by directly acting on tme besides thecrosstalk with cafs [] pdgfr beta in stromalï¬broblasts may mediate pdgfbinduced tam recruitment  thus implicating a role of pdgfr beta in tumorstroma to facilitate tumor progression most recently it wasfurther shown that speciï¬c targeting of pdgfr beta kinaseactivity in tme inhibited cancer growth and vascularizationin cancers with high pdgfb expression such as llc  therefore this indicates the diverse role of pdgfb andpdgfr beta in facilitating tumor angiogenesis and progression at diï¬erent cellular levels in tme pdgfr beta is demonstrated as a target of telomeric repeat binding factor trf2 that is further activated transcriptionally by wt1  pdgfb and pdgfr beta have further been identiï¬edas critical targets of ppar betadelta via a direct transactivation mechanism in vivo  in conclusion a variety of key signal molecules involvedin tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression and metastasishave either been identiï¬ed as ppar betadelta direct targetsor largely upregulated in the vascular ppar betadelta overexpression model in vivo reported recently   thus pparbetadelta activation seems to give rise to a highly angiogenicphenotype and even plays a hallmark role in promotingtumor angiogenesis and progression interestingly it appearsthat there could also exist a widely interactive networkbetween the downstream protumorangiogenic moleculesas described above therefore the crosstalk network is established between ppar betadelta and the various signal molecules and also between those molecules figure

7567,Colon_Cancer,the heterogeneity of cancer cells is generally accepted and astem celllike subpopulation that is called cancer stem cellscscs has been identiï¬ed in various types of malignanttumors although the lack of consensus on the deï¬nitioncscs are widely recognized as a small subpopulation amongcancer cells with the properties of selfrenewal and tumor initiation as cscs play a critical role in the recurrence andmetastasis of cancer   targeting the cscs is thought to bea promising approach for curing cancera large number of past studies have tried to identify andcharacterize the cscs as normal tissuespeciï¬c stem cellsare considered as the main origin of cancer   the cscsare also thought to be inherited at least partially the characterization of normal tissuespeciï¬c stem cells thereforemany studies on the identiï¬cationpuriï¬cation of cscs havesimply shared markers of hematopoietic stem cells includingthe most popularly used cell surface markers of cd44 andcd133 [ ] cd44 is a type i transmembrane glycoproteinthat is expressed on hematopoietic ï¬broblastic and glial cellsand functionally known to mediate cellcell and cellmatrixinteractions previous studies have demonstrated that thecd44 is not only a biomarker but also plays critical roles inthe maintenance of cscs the resistance to various therapiesstresses and the metastasis of cancer cells []cd133 is originally identiï¬ed as protein expressing on thecell surface of hematopoietic stem cells   and has subsequently been found to be critical in the maintenance ofstemness of stem cells in various tissues [] cd133has also been found in some csc [] which contributesto therapeutic resistance through the activation of akt bcl2and mapkpi3k signaling pathways [] although theexpressions of cd44 and cd133 in cancer cells likely associate with the resistances to radiotherapy chemotherapy andvarious stresses the diï¬erent signiï¬cance between cd44and cd133 has not yet been well understoodin this study we investigated whether the expression ofcd44 and cd133 in human colorectal cancer cells hct8diï¬erently contributed to drug resistance our data indicated 0cstem

complex mechanisms are also likelyinvolved in the dxr resistance in cd44cd133 cells discussionby using the wellrecognized cell surface markers of cd44and cd133 for csc identiï¬cation we tried to separate thehct8 human colon cancer cells into cd44 cd44 cd44cd133 and cd44cd133 subpopulations and then investigated how the expressions of cd44 and cd133 associatedwith drug resistance actually we checked several cancer celllines on the expression of cd44 and cd133 including helacells and a549 cells however both hela cells and a549 cellsshowed almost  expression of cd44 only the hct8cells showed a partial expression of cd44 about  anda rare expression of cd133 therefore we only isolateddiï¬erent subpopulations from hct8 cells for this studyfirst we found that the expression level of cd44 keptvery stable in the cd44cd133 cells but gradually declinedin cd44cd133 cells during a cell passaging process on theother hand some of cd44 cells shifted to express cd44 during a cell passaging process figure 1c these ï¬ndings suggested the plasticity of cd44 expression in hct8 cellsactually ohata et al reported that cd44 highexpressedcells from human intractable colon cancer patients can diï¬erentiate into cd44 lowexpressed cells and a fraction of cd44lowexpressed cells can also generate cd44 highexpressedcells in a xenograft mouse model   however it is unclearwhy the cd44cd133 cells but not cd44cd133 cellsstably maintain the expression level of cd44 unlike theextensive expression of cd44 with high plasticity the expression of cd133 was only observed in very few of the hct8cells with poor plasticitya number of previous studies have demonstrated thatcscs are likely resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs thecd44cd133 cells but not the cd44 and cd44cd133cells showed dxr resistance figure 2a according to thisdata the expression of cd133 but not cd44 seems to beclosely associated with drug resistance actuallythesecd44cd133 cells showed the enhanced expression ofabcb1 and the decreased intracellular accumulation ofdxr figures 2b and 2c liu et al reported that nonsmallcell lung cancer cells treated with lowdose cddp aresuï¬cient to enrich cd133 cells and upregulate abcb1expression through notch signaling which thereforeincreases the crossresistance to dxr   however theinhibition of abcb1 by verapamil only partially improvedthe dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells in this studyto ï¬nd other potential mechanisms involving in thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells we investigatedseveral interesting aspects including the stress protectionand redox regulation we found that p38mapk one of themost popular protein kinases known to be activated byinï¬ammatory cytokines lipopolysaccharide osmotic shockultraviolet light and other stresses was more obviouslyinduced by dxr in cd44cd133 cells than cd44cd133cells figure  moreover the activation of p38 mapk wasnot dependent on the intracellular accumulation of dxrfigure dxr is known to insert between the base pairs of dna oftumor cells and exhibits antitumor eï¬ects by suppressing thebiosynthesis of both dna and rna through the inhibitionof dna polymerase rna polymerase and topoisomeraseii reactions furthermore it is believed that dxr has theability to generate suï¬cient ros to raise oxidative stressindeed we observed dxrinduced ros generation in bothcd44cd133 and cd44cd133 cells butthe dxrinduced ros generation was detected even higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells independent on the intracellular accumulation of dxr figures 5a 2b and 3bsuggesting the enhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsthe keap1nrf2 control system plays a central role in theantioxidant defense mechanisms nrf2 is known as a transcription factor to activate various genes involving in biological defense mechanisms it has been reported that nrf2 isconstantly expressed in many cancer cells [] moreover the enhanced expression of nrf2 has been conï¬rmedto associate with poor prognosis of cancer patients []in our study nrf2 expression was detected higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells and the diï¬erence in nrf2expression was observed even clearer between cells with dxradministrationindependent on the dxr accumulationfigure 5b these ï¬ndings also clearly indicate theenhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsalthough the absence of direct evidence by interferenceexperiment pathways involving in the stress protection andredox regulation might at least partially contributed to thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsvery strangely our data showed that the silencing ofcd133 expression in cd44cd133 cells by sirna couldonly partially increase the cytotoxicity of dxr figure 6bbut did not change the expression of abcb1 and the intracellular accumulation of dxr figure 6c other unknownmechanisms beyond the drug excretion and redox regulationare asked to be deï¬ned on the dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsbased on data from the present study the expression ofcd133 rather than cd44 more closely

adipogenesis both in mscs and inincluding the wellstudied pparÎ and ccaatcscsenhancerbinding proteins cebps   as well as othercell factors that have been recently shown to have an important role in adipocyte diï¬erentiation we focus on understanding the complex regulatory mechanism of adipocytediï¬erentiation that can contribute to the clinical treatmentof human diseases including those caused by obesity andadipocytes dysfunction especially for the malignant tumorwhich can be transdiï¬erentiated into mature adipocytes adipocyte differentiationcell proliferation and diï¬erentiation are two opposingprocesses and there is a transition between these two processes in the early stages of adipocyte diï¬erentiation theinteraction of cell cycle regulators and diï¬erentiation factors produces a cascade of events which ultimately resultsin the expression of adipocyte phenotype   adipogenesishas diï¬erent stages each stage has a speciï¬c gene expression pattern   in general adipocyte diï¬erentiation ofpluripotent stem cells is divided into two phases the ï¬rstphase known as determination involves the commitment ofpluripotent stem cells to preadipocytes the preadipocytescannot be distinguished morphologically from their precursor cells but also have lost the potential to diï¬erentiate intoother cell types in the second phase which is known asterminal diï¬erentiation the preadipocytes gradually acquirethe characteristics of mature adipocytes and acquire physiological functions including lipid transport and synthesisinsulin sensitivity and the secretion of adipocytespeciï¬cproteins  the diï¬erentiation of precursor adipocytes is also dividedinto four stages proliferation mitotic cloning early diï¬erentiation and terminal diï¬erentiation   after the precursors are inoculated into the cell culture plates the cellsgrow exponentially until they converge after reaching contact inhibition the growth rate slows and gradually stagnatesand the proliferation of precursor adipocytes stops which isvery necessary for initiating the diï¬erentiation of precursoradipocytes adipocyte precursors exhibit transient mitosiscalled clonal expansion a process that relies on the actionof induced diï¬erentiation factors some preadipocyte cellsmouse cell lines 3t3l1 3t3f442a undergo one or tworounds of cell division prior to diï¬erentiation   whereasother cell lines mouse c3h10t12 diï¬erentiating into adipocyte do not undergo mitosis clonal expansion  whether mitotic clonal expansion is required for adiposediï¬erentiation remains controversial however it is certainthat some of the checkpoint proteins for mitosis regulateaspects of adipogenesis [ ] when cells enter the terminaldiï¬erentiation stage the de novo synthesis of fatty acidsincreases significantly the transcription factors and adipocyterelated genes work cooperatively to maintain precursor adipocyte diï¬erentiation into mature adipocytes containing largelipid droplets   regulatory pathways inpreadipocytes commitmentadipocyte diï¬erentiation is a complex process in which geneexpression is ï¬nely regulated the most basic regulatory network of adipose diï¬erentiation has not been updated inrecent years but some factors and signaling pathways thatdo aï¬ect adipose diï¬erentiation have been continuouslyreported adipocyte diï¬erentiation is the result of the geneexpression that determines the phenotype of adipocyteswhich is a complex and delicate regulatory process figure  wnt signal pathway in adipogenesis wnt signaling isimportant for adipocytes

vertebrate hh ligands including sonic hedgehogshhindian hedgehog ihh and desert hedgehogdhh have been identiï¬ed and initiated a signaling cascademediated by patched ptch1 and ptch2 receptors [ ]hh

cebps andkrÃ¼ppellike factors klfs have all been shown to induceat least one of the two pparÎ promoters in contrast antiadipogenic transcription factor gata functioned in part byrepressing pparÎ

other tissues although both can promote adipocytediï¬erentiation pparÎ2 could do so eï¬ectively at very lowligand concentration compared with pparÎ1   the twoprotein isoforms are generated by

deï¬ciencyimpairs the development of adipose tissue and insulin sensitivity  there are transcriptional cascades between adipocytesgenes including pparÎ and cebpÎ± which are the coreadipocyte

eï¬cientlyin the absence of pparÎ cebp cannot induce cebpÎ±expression in the absence of pparÎ which is required torelease histone deacetylase1 hdac1 from the cebpÎ±promoter   furthermore ectopic cebpÎ± expressioncannot induce adipogenesis in pparÎï¬broblasts  however cebpÎ± also plays an important role in diï¬erentiated adipocytes overexpression of exogenous pparÎ incebpÎ±deï¬cient cells

7569,Colon_Cancer,the periparturient period is one of the most challenging periods in dairy cows and encompasses the  a0wk prior to and  a0wk after parturition  the  nutrient  requirements  of  dairy  cows  change greatly during this time largely due to the exponential growth of the gravid uterus and fetus followed by the demands of lactation nrc  inflammation oxidative stress and adipose tissue mobilization  lead  to  a  reduction  in  dry  matter  intake  dmi during the periparturient period this reduction in dmi leads to a negative nutrient balance nnb with a shortfall in the nutrient availability  for  the  cow  and  fetus  ingvartsen  and  andersen   additionally  this  reduction  in  dmi  also  increases  the risk of metabolic ketosis fatty liver milk fever and immunerelated disorders the risk of these diseases poor reproduction and low efficiency is greatly impacted by the degree and length of time during which these systems metabolism and immune response remain out of balance loor et a0al 2013a much of the research  over  the  last  decade  have  examined  these  biological interactions to identify the mechanisms behind the metabolic physiologic  and  immune  adaptations  that  occur  during  the periparturient period loor et a0al 2013a 2013b roche et a0al  bradford et a0al it  is  now  known  that  nutrients  such  as  amino  acids  aa serve  functional  roles  outside  of  their  use  as  building  blocks for  proteins  and  have  immunomodulatory  properties  and interact through common biochemical pathways eg 1carbon metabolism  figure a0   this  concept  has  been  well  explored in  nonruminant  species  li  et a0 al    sikalidis    with nutritional  management  during  the  periparturient  period continuing  to  be  an  active  area  of  research  it  is  important  to develop a system understanding the potential immunometabolic role  that  dietary  aa  may  play  during  this  period  thus  the objective of this review is to provide an overview of physiological adaptations  during  the  periparturient  period  the  immune system and methods to assess immune function and oxidative stress this will be followed by a more specific discussion of the immunometabolic roles of specific aa and their potential effects in  dairy  cow  during  the  periparturient  period  the  potential effects  of  enhanced  aa  supply  during  the

with  moderate  carcass  protein  losses  reported  even when animals are fed to their predicted metabolizable protein requirements  bell  et a0 al    additionally  circulating  aa concentrations

nadir around day  postpartum zhou et a0al 2016b which corresponds to a peak in total disease incidence during  early  lactation  ingvartsen    this  decrease  in circulating  aa  is  likely  associated  with  the  increased  use  of aa  for  gluconeogenesis  as  well  as  for  hepatic  production  of app thus it is important to investigate how supplemental aa during  the  periparturient  period  may  modulate  metabolism and  immune  responses  to  promote  production  and  reduce susceptibility to diseasegeneral overview of the immune a0systemthe immune system consists of both the adaptive and innate immune responses which are linked together through signaling molecules  such  as  cytokines  the  innate  immune  system  is the  first  line  of  defense  and  includes  physical  barriers  such as  epithelial  cell  layers  that  express  tight  cell  junctions  and the  mucus  layer  of  the  respiratory  gastrointestinal  and genitourinary tracts chaplin  cells involved in the innate immune  response  include  macrophages  polymorphonuclear neutrophils  pmn  dendritic  cells  mast  cells  eosinophils natural killer cells and natural killer t cells turvey and broide  the  focus  of  the  present  review  is  on  the  effects  of aa on  phagocytic  cells  that  is  cells  that  engulf  and  kill  such  as macrophages  and  pmn  macrophages  not  only  phagocytose invading pathogens but also produce cytokines such as ils and tnfÎ±  which  initiate  innate  and  adaptive  immune  responses and recruit pmn to the site of infection chaplin the  adaptive  immune  response  consists  of t  lymphocytes b  lymphocytes  and  humoral  factors  marshall  et a0 al   there  are  two  types  of t  lymphocytes  cytotoxic t  cells  cd8 cells and thelper th cells cd4 cells marshall et a0al  cytotoxic t  cells  detect  and  eliminate  infected  cells  while th cells produce ils and interferonÎ³ ingvartsen and moyes  the b lymphocytes are cells that produce antibodies that bind to  antigens  on  the  surface  of  pathogens  to  mark  them  for destruction marshall et a0al  0ccoleman et a0al   s177aa immune function and oxidative a0stressduring  the  periparturient  period  the  metabolic  status  is associated with the inflammatory regulation of peripheral blood mononuclear  cells  with  a  more  pronounced  inflammatory response in those cells

protein  kinase  b  akt  and mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  mtor  pathway  which  may modulate cytokine production mann et a0al  aa can directly and indirectly alter the immune system besides being used in energy metabolism reactions and the synthesis of proteins aa are critical for the synthesis of other functional molecules such as the antioxidants gsh and taurine no histamine and hydrogen peroxide  li  et a0 al   thus  this  section  of  the  review  will focus on the role that aa play in modulating immune function and  oxidative  stress  in  dairy  cows  during  the  periparturient period a a0special focus will be placed on aa involved in 1carbon metabolism as this represents an interconnected route through which  aa  could  impact  molecular  events  such  as

supplementation dampened this hyperresponse likely through improvements in oxidative stress vailatiriboni et a0al the  recent  work  by  lopreiato  et a0 al    investigated  the effects  of  incubating  bovine  pmnl  with  met  andor  choline and  observed  that  supplemental  met  coupled  with  adequate choline  enhanced  gene  expression  of  tlr2  and  lselectin sell  which  are  pathogen  recognition  mechanisms  in  the same experiment cells incubated without choline had greater mrna  abundance  of  il1b  il6  il10  and  myeloperoxidase mpo glutathione reductase gsr gss cystathionine gammalyase  cth  and  cysteine  sulfinic  acid  decarboxylase  csad indicating  greater  inflammation  and  oxidative  stress  this effect  however  was  ameliorated  by  supplementing  additional met  lopreiato  et a0 al   thus  the  increased  dmi  and  milk production observed when feeding rpm can be partly explained by  a  reduction  in  inflammation  as  it  directly  at  the  hepatic level  and  by  dampening  the  immune  cell  overresponse  and indirectly reducing oxidative stress decreases circulating proinflammatory cytokinesenhanced  met  supply  during  the  periparturient  period has  also  been  associated  with  changes  in  mtor  signaling mtor  is  a  serinethreonine  kinase  that  plays  a  central  role  in integrating environmental cues from growth factors nutrients particularly aa and energy powell et a0al  in dairy cattle mtor has traditionally been studied in the context of its role in regulating protein synthesis however work from humans and nonruminant species has indicated that mtor is an important regulator  of  immune  responses  powell  et a0 al    jones  and pearce  when activated by aa mtor directs an activation of anabolic metabolism which allows growth proliferation and development this  makes  the  activation  of  mtor  in  immune cells  particularly  important  for  maintaining  proliferation  and without  proper  activation  cells  may  enter  periods  of  growth arrest  jones  and  pearce    methionine  specifically  may interact with mtor via the production of sam specifically sam can  bind  to  sadenosylmethionine  sensor  upstream  of  mtor samtor  a  protein  that  inhibits  mtor  complex    mtorc1 by  interacting  with  gtpaseactivating  protein  activity  towards rags  gator1 gu et a0al  when sam binds to samtor it  inhibits  the  association  of  samtor  and  gator1  allowing mtorc1 to be activated gu et a0al to  our  knowledge  there  is  only  one  study  investigating the expression of mtor signaling proteins in immune cells in dairy  cattle  and  work  is  also  lacking  in  nonruminant  species in  periparturient  cows  the  activation  of  aktmtor  signaling in  immune  cells  was  reduced  postpartum  compared  with prepartum mann et a0al  importantly agrawal et a0al  also identified the expression of aa transporters and the kyoto encyclopedia  of  genes  and  genomes  kegg  pathways  related to  1carbon  metabolism  and  mtor  in  pmnl  from  peripartal cows a a0 list  of  these  transporters  and  kegg  pathways  related to  aa  and  1carbon  metabolism  are  summarized  in  table a0  together these studies support the potential importance of aa for nutrient signaling in immune a0cellsrecent work indicating that enhanced met supply activates mtor  signaling  in  the  mammary  gland  supports  its  role  in enhancing  protein  synthesis  for  example  in  vitro  enhancing met  supply  to  immortalized  bovine  mammary  epithelial cells  bmec  by  varying  the  ratio  of  lys  to  met  increased  the concentration  and  utilization  of  essential  aa  particularly branchedchain  aa  bcaa  dong  et a0 al    this  change  0cwas  potentially  mediated  by  alterations  in  aa  transporters controlled by mtor dong et a0al  other studies with bmec have also revealed a potential for greater mtor activation when met supply is enhanced nan et a0al  sala ma et a0al in  vivo  the  effects  of  supplemental  met  during  the periparturient  period  on  mtor  signaling  were  explored  using cows from the study by batistel et a0al  in the mammary gland  cows  receiving  rpm  had  lower  protein  abundance  of total  mtor  and  phosphorylated  mtor  pmtor  compared with  control  cows  on  day    postpartum  but  the  ratio  of pmtortotal  mtor  was  not  different  suggesting  that  there was no difference in mtor activation between treatments ma et a0 al    however  changes  in aa  transporters  and  insulin signaling  indicated  that  insulin  sensitivity  of  the  mammary gland was enhanced with supplemental met ma et a0al  in subcutaneous adipose tissue the mrna and protein abundance of  some  aa  transporters  and  pmtor  were  upregulated  with enhanced  met  supply  while  changes  in  insulin  signaling  and plasma glucose also indicated that met helped improve insulin sensitivity  liang  et a0 al  2019b  thus  enhancing  met  supply during  the  periparturient  period  may  lead  to  mtor  activation in  immune  cells  as  well  as  improved  nutrient  uptake  which could help to support proliferation and development additional work in ruminants and nonruminants is needed to understand whether met modulates mtor signaling in immune cellscysteinecysteine can be synthesized endogenously from homocysteine as  described  earlier  and  is  needed  to  synthesize  gsh  and taurine  gsh  is  synthesized  via  two  enzymes  gcl  and  gss lushchak  to synthesize taurine cysteine sulfinic acid is first synthesized from cysteine by cysteine dioxygenase and can then be utilized by csad to produce taurine park et a0al  dietary  cys  has  been  explored  as  a  way  to  improve  health  in
